Governance concerns power, \nand applying an understanding of the distribution and sharing of \npower to the management of information technologies. <P>\n\n Information management seeks to answer the same questions as \n those raised in politics.  The management of information defines \n how one organizes people to achieve cooperation.  With the \n proliferation of computers, information systems have become \n an inseparable element of all management acts.  Only the \n technical aspects of such decisions can be safely delegated \n to computer and telecommunication specialists.  Computerization \n is the conduct of management by other means, and therefore \n cannot be delegated, but must be retained as an essential \n managerial skill.  It is the purpose of this book to convey \n what are some of the fundamental issues that need to be addressed \n by management before computerization can be seen as a safe economic \n bet. <P>\n \n Computers offer new options for creating, distributing, \n retrieving and preserving information.  They make access \n to sources of knowledge easier, faster and for less cost \n than ever before.  Computer networks now pass information \n directly to customers, employees, and citizens to make decisions \n previously requiring intermediaries.  As result, old \n relationships are severed as new ones are created.  Whenever \n that happens, there will be conflicts that require resolution \n if we are to take advantage of the enormous power of \n information technologies. <P>\n \n \n The resolution of these conflicting interests now \n requires the introduction of formal governance processes \n that will keep up with the accelerating rate of change \n both in technology as well as in competitive relationships.  \n The US Constitution should be seen as a precedent-setting \n event in which superbly crafted acts of governance yielded \n decisive economic advantages in the global marketplace.  \n Similarly, the institution of superior methods of organizational \n \"information governance\" should be seen as one of the \n prerequisites for an organization to acquire the capacity \n to compete in the \"information age.\" <P>\n \n This work should be read as a prerequisite for its sequel that \n will address the specific issues how to proceed with the \n construction of an \"Information Constitution\" for an \n organization where computers have become the primary channel \n of communication with suppliers and customers as well as the \n key for achieving internal coordination within the organization. <P>\n \n  <H3>Table of Contents</H3> \n  <b>THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION GOVERNANCE  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</b><br>\nWhy \"Governance\"?

It was up to the\nmanagers of information to evaluate those engaged in the production of\ngoods and services - in delivering what is now recorded as cost-of-goods\nsold.  The owners of firms have now come to realize that it is the\nmanagement of information resources that makes the difference in the\nfortunes of a firm.  The wages and salaries of those engaged in\ninformation management now consume over forty percent of all\ncompensation expenses.  With that realization comes the urgency to treat\ninformation management as if it were a critical resource to be analyzed\nfor its lasting effects on overall corporate performance.  It is the\npurpose of this report to show how that can be done by concentrating on\nmeasuring and assessing the productivity of information, the efficiency\nof information technology and the effective deployment of knowledge\ncapital. <P>\n\n It is the objective of this work to illustrate how to\ncalculate and analyze the Information Productivity &reg;, the Information\nTechnology Efficiency and the Knowledge Capital&reg; of the General\nCorporation. <P>\n\n <li> Information Productivity Assessment shows how\nGeneral Corporation can benchmark its productivity in comparison with\nits peers and competitors. <P>\n\n<li> Information Technology Assessment\nshows how General Corporation can benchmark its information technology\nexpenditures against comparable firms. <P>\n\n<li> Knowledge Capital\nAssessment shows how General Corporation can assess its performance in\naccumulating its Knowledge Capital assets. <P>\n\n The immediate readers for\nthis report should be General Corporation planners and budget analysts\nwho need improved quantitative methods for analyzing their\norganization's performance in terms that relate to business process\nimprovement programs as well as to investments in information\ntechnologies.  However, the principal customers are policy-making\ncorporate executives who are increasingly asking questions about the\neffectiveness of their information management processes and\ntechnologies.  The methods outlined in this text should be helpful not\nonly as diagnostic measures for policy-level reviews, but also as\nongoing practice for tracking the performance of the\ninformation-consuming elements of corporate expense. <P>\n\n This example of\na typical diagnostic report prepared by Strassmann, Inc. for its clients\nis one of the products that have origins in research begun in 1982 and\nis described in a number of books listed on <a href=\"http://www.infoeconomics.com\">\nwww.infoeconomics.com</a>. \nAdditional insights can be gained from these publications for an\nimproved understanding of about assumptions that back up the findings\npresented in these illustrative assessments. <P>\n\n If it is the objective\nof information management to attain what I call \"Information\nSuperiority\" then it follows that such a state can be reached only after\ncompleting every step in a well-defined sequence.  One must start such a\nsequence by completing Information Productivity, Information Technology\nand Knowledge Capital \"Assessments.\" Those will identify the fundamental\nissues that information management actions need to address.  Only after\nsuch diagnostics are completed would it be prudent to proceed with what\nusually occupies most of the time of IT executives, namely, \"Project\nPlanning\", \"Process Improvement\", \"Resources Management\" and finally\nevery technologist's favorite the making of technology-related\ndecisions.  This only confirms a proven Scout saying: \"If you do not\nknow where you are, even a detailed map will not be of much use.\" <P>\n\n\n\n   <H3>Contents</H3>  \n  Introduction        <BR>\n Alignment 9<BR>\n Why Assessment Comes First        9<BR>\n Information Productivity Assessment       11<BR>\n Choosing Look-Alike firms        11<BR>\n Measuring Information Productivity       14<BR>\n Ranking of Information Productivity      16 <BR>\n Summary of Information Productivity Assessment   21<BR>\n Information Technology Assessment        23<BR>\n The Importance of Information Technology 23<BR>\n Critical Indicators      24<BR>\n Information Workforce Trends     31<BR>\n I.T. budget per employee 33<BR>\n Assessing Information Technology Spending        34<BR>\n I.T.

The 1999 report stated\nthat information industries contributed 35 percent of the nation's real\neconomic growth.  The 2000 report stated that information industries\ncontributed \"nearly a third\" of the real growth of the U.S. economy.<P>\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the rationale and methods used\nfor estimating the relationship between the contributions of information\nindustries and their effect on the U.S. economy.  This examination has\nresulted in the following findings:<P>\n\n<ul>\n<li> The DOC definition of the scope of \"information industries\" is\nbroader than what is the generally accepted definition of \"I.T.\"\nanywhere in the world.  The DOC included sectors such as radio\nbroadcasting, television broadcasting, office machines (copiers,\nduplicators, fax machines), laboratory analytical equipment, instruments\nfor manufacturing testing and measuring electricity, electronic\ncapacitor manufacturing, household audio and video equipment, wired\ntelecommunications carriers, paging equipment, cellular and other\nwireless communications.<P>\n\n<li>   Based on current spending \"I.T.\" would account for 3.91% of the\ntotal Gross Domestic Income (GDI) instead of 8.29% as claimed by the\nDOC.<P>\n\n<li> The contribution of \"I.T.\" to the nominal dollar growth in the GDI\nfrom 1995 to 1998 would be only 9.01% instead of 12.15%, as defined by\nthe DOC.<P>\n\n<li> To place the role in the most favorable perspective and thus assign to\n\"I.T.\" the leading explanation for the persistence of low inflation and\nlow unemployment while being the primary driver of rising productivity\nthe DOC applied \"hedonic deflationary adjustments\" to the published GDI\nnumbers.

They are the individuals \nwho leave the workplace every night (and may never return), \nstoring in their heads the know-how acquired while receiving \nfull pay.  Their brains are repositories of knowledge \naccumulated over untold hours of listening and talking while \nnot delivering any goods or services to paying customers. \nThe employees' minds, and the files they manage, carry a \nshare of the company's knowledge capital.  This makes every \nemployee a custodian of the most important assets a firm \nowns, even though these assets never show up on any financial \nreports.  The disciplines and methods how to account and \nsafeguard knowledge assets are either non-existent or at most \nrudimentary. <p>\n\nBy contrast, the custodianship of financial assets has become a \nwell-defined discipline that depends on procedures and \nregulations on how to account for and report these resources.  \nOver a period of many years, an elaborate framework \ninvolving accountants, auditors, reporting standards and \ngovernment oversight has been developed to do that.  <p>\n\nWhat has changed now is the discovery that the financial \nassets of corporations represent only a portion of the total \ncorporate assets.  In many cases the valuation of the financial \nassets is dwarfed by the implied valuation of its knowledge \nassets.  As society evolves from an industrial model how an \neconomy functions to an information based economy, \nknowledge assets become increasingly important. <p>\n\nFinancial executives have shown a remarkable reluctance to \nput numbers on something many consider to be intangible.  \nHowever, with the rising importance of non-financial assets \nthe time has come to place the management of knowledge on \nthe agenda of executive managers, financial analysts and \nshareholders.  To that end, one must start by developing an \nindependently verifiable quantification of the worth of \nknowledge assets. <p>\n\nKnowledge capital can be calculated because it reveals itself \nas the most important contributory influence in explaining \nhow a firm earns its profits in excess of its cost of financial \ncapital.  The allocation of the respective contributions of \nknowledge capital and financial capital to profits can be made \nif one recognizes that financial capital is now a commodity  -  \nreadily available at a price that reflects the interest rate that a \nfirm pays for its borrowings, the price a shareholder can earn \nfor an investment made at a lower risk.  However, what makes \na company prosper is not financial capital  -  which anyone \ncan obtain for a price  -  but the effectiveness with which \nknowledge capital is put to use. Therefore, the annual returns \nrealized on knowledge capital can be isolated after paying a \n\"rental\" for the financial capital and then subtracting that \namount from profits as reported by the accountants. <p>\n\nWhat remains is what economists call an \"economic profit\" \nand what some consultants call the \"economic value-added.\"  I \nlabel that residual as the \"knowledge value-added\" because it \naccounts for those missing elements that represent everything \nnot shown on a conventional balance sheet.  By filtering out \nthe contributions of financial capital from the reported profits, \nwe are left with a residual that is entirely attributable to what \nknowledge capital has actually delivered.  In other words, \nknowledge value-added is the annual yield a firm realizes \nfrom its knowledge capital assets. <p>\n\nOnce you know the yield from a capital asset, calculating the \nvalue of its principal is straightforward.  All you have to do is \nto divide the value of knowledge value-added by the costs of \nthat capital and you get a verifiable and independently \nreproducible worth of a firm's knowledge capital. <p>\n\nTo provide an overview of Knowledge Capital&reg; in Europe is a \nvast undertaking.   Such a study would have to cover issues \nrelated to economic growth, corporate structure, the costs of \ncapital and the rates at which various firms have demonstrated \na consistent capability of accumulating Knowledge Capital in \npreference to financial assets. <p>\n\nThis report should be seen as a first installment in a more \ncomprehensive effort to map the characteristics of Knowledge \nCapital formation in Europe.  This study comes in two parts. \n<p>\n\nPart I examines the overall characteristics of the distribution of \nKnowledge Capital without dwelling in greater detail into the \nrelationships and trends that lead to its influence of corporate \nprofitability and long term viability.  The financial statistics \nare expressed in terms of Euros currency to reflect the plans to \napply similar analyses to other European countries for \ncomparability.  All information cited herein is available form \npublic sources and reflects results of audited financial reports \nfor public corporations, as tabulated by the Standard & Poor's \nGlobal financial services databases.  <p>\n\nPart II examines some of the patterns of Knowledge Capital of \nthe U.K. economy.  The corporate population covered includes \ndetailed data about 1,152 U.K firms with a total workforce of \n7.1 million which represents a large share of what I term as the \nengines of knowledge capital creation.  Similar analyses will \nbe prepared for other European countries in due course.\n\n<H3>CONTENTS</H3>\nContents\t4<br>\nFigures\t7<br>\nIntroduction\t8<br>\nSummary Findings\t11<br>\nPart I: Knowledge Capital in European Firms\t13<br>\nEffect of the Cost of Capital\t14<br>\nComparisons of Knowledge Capital Gainers vs. Losers\t15<br>\nConcentration of Knowledge Capital\t17<br>\nIndustrial Sector Profiles\t18<br>\nSectoral Concentration Ratios\t21<br>\nPart II - Country Case  -  The U.K. Knowledge Capital\t23<br>\nConcentration of Knowledge Capital\t23<br>\nSectoral Distribution of Knowledge Capital\t25<br>\nKnowledge Capital per Employee\t26<br>\nMarket Valuation of Knowledge Capital\t29<br>\nExample of U.K. Knowledge/Financial Capital Ratios\t31<br>\nSummary Findings, U.K. Case\t32<br>\nAppendix A  -  Knowledge Capital Rankings\t34<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Belgian Firms\t34<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Danish Firms\t37<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Finnish Firms\t40<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of French Firms\t43<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of German Firms\t55<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Irish Firms\t66<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Italian Firms\t68<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Netherlands Firms\t72<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Norwegian Firms\t76<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Portuguese Firms\t79<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Spanish Firms\t80<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of Swedish Firms\t83<br>\nKnowledge Capital Rankings of U.K. Firms\t88<br>\nAppendix B  -  Valuation of Knowledge Capital\t111\n\n\n\n\n\n<H3>FIGURES</H3>\n\nFigure 1  -  Summary of the Scope of the Report on European Knowledge Capital\t13<br>\nFigure 2  -  Risk-free Cost of Capital for European Countries\t15<br>\nFigure 3  -  Profiles of Positive and Negative Contributions to Knowledge Capital\t16<br>\nFigure 5  -  Knowledge Capital can be Found to be Highly Concentrated\t17<br>\nFigure 6  -  Sectoral Profile of European Firms\t19<br>\nFigure 7  -  Sectoral Ratios of Positive and Negative Knowledge Capital Firms\t20<br>\nFigure 8  -  Sectoral Concentration of Knowledge Capital\t21<br>\nFigure 9  -  Sectoral Concentration of Knowledge Capital vs. Firm Size\t22<br>\nFigure 10  -  Distribution of Knowledge Capital Among U.K. Firms\t23<br>\nFigure 11  -  The Top-Ranking U.K. Knowledge Capital Firms\t24<br>\nFigure 12  -  Knowledge/Finance Capital Ratios for Sectors of the U.K. Economy\t25<br>\nFigure 13  -  Knowledge/Finance Capital Ratios for U.K. Basic Materials Firms\t26<br>\nFigure 14  -  Knowledge Capital per Employee for U.K. Industrial Sectors\t27<br>\nFigure 15  -  Distribution of Knowledge Capital per Employee for Utility Sector\t28<br>\nFigure 16  -  Knowledge Capital per Employee for the Top Ranked Utility Sector\t28<br>\nFigure 17  -  Relationship Between Actual and Calculated Market Valuations\t29<br>\nFigure 18  -  Actual and Calculated Market Valuations for Financial Sector\t30<br>\n\n","links": "","buy_link_bookmasters": "","buy_link_mightywords": "","buy_link_miva": "https://qs1473.pair.com/straz/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Store_Code=IEP&Screen=OINF&Action=ADPR&Attributes=Yes&Product_Code=D6&Quantity=1","status": "T"}, {"ebook_id": 7,"title": "The Persistence of the Computer Paradox: A Critique of Efforts to Disprove the Computer Paradox","author": "Paul A.

Recent assertions that the Computer Paradox is not valid any more have been countered by arguments that it persists as an intrinsic characteristic of the U.S. economy.  Meanwhile, a concerted effort to repeal the paradox was launched from academic as well as government sources.  These have been largely motivated by the need to justify the enormous expansion of spending on computerization, especially in the period from 1990 through 2000.  Nevertheless, this paper shows that the Computer Paradox as valid as an observation as it was in 1987. <p>\n\nThe fact that contradictions about the financial benefits of the single largest share of business investments have been allowed to continue for more than a decade are a reflection on the inadequacies of economic analysis of how to assess national productivity gains.

This book is written to help Information Technology providers \nunderstand why cost-justification has become such an issue for CIOs and presents \nthe background necessary for using Return on Investment (ROI) as a vital sales \nand marketing tool. <p>\n\nThe author, Tom Pisello, is currently CEO and co-founder of \nAlinean, developer of customized ROI sales tools for IT vendors, and a former \nGartner Managing VP and noted ROI and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) expert, who \nhas worked with hundreds of leading IT vendors over the past eight years to \ndevelop customized ROI selling tools and models. This work is a guide that will \nhelp IT vendors understand ROI and develop their own strategies, methodologies \nand models to apply ROI analysis as a tool to improve the analysis, procurement \nand financial management of their technology solutions.<p>\n\nAimed at Information Technology (IT) provider executives, product managers, \nmarketing managers, sales professionals and consultants, this book takes a \nmicro-economic view of IT projects, providing the background, methodology and \ntools to predict the costs and benefits of these projects to a prospect‚s \nbusiness. This book will illustrate how such techniques can be applied to \nshorten the technology sales cycle, increase sales effectiveness, gain \ncompetitive advantage, and increase the returns from the solutions.<p>\n\nThose who are selling IT hardware, software, and solutions are under \nincreasing scrutiny to prove the value of their technology. Businesses are \nreacting to the end of the greatest period of technology growth during the \nInternet bubble - with a backlash - demanding that every project add to the \nbottom-line. IT solution providers must understand how to use the time-honored \nfinancial analysis tools of business and apply the principal of ROI directly to \ntheir products and offerings. This book helps to prepare the Information \nTechnology solution provider for the questions and requirements that customers \nwill be presenting in the months and years to come.<p>\n\nThe introduction makes a case for why ROI is such an important topic today, \ndiscussing how we arrived at the current market opportunity, why CIOs are \nstruggling with budget and value issues, and what lies ahead. The following \nchapters discusses the basics of traditional ROI analysis, introduces a new and \nimproved ROI model and methodology that will help IT vendors better make their \nbusiness case to skeptical CIOs, and provides useful tips for applying ROI to \nselling IT solutions. The Appendices provide references and case studies, \nproviding the building blocks for IT vendors to understand ROI, construct their \nown ROI models, and apply ROI with prospects and customers.<p>\n\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" bordercolor=\"#111111\" id=\"AutoNumber1\" width=\"357\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\"><i>Preface</i></td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\"><i>&nbsp;i</i></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\"><i>Forward </i></td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\"><i>iii</i></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\"><b>Introduction </b></td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\"><b>1</b></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Challenge of the Computer Paradox </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Labor Displacement </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Asset Displacement </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">4</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Overhead Displacement </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">4</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">What it Means </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">5</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\"><b>Section I - IT Spending and ROI </b></td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\"><b>7</b></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">IT Spending and the Internet Bubble </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">7</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">The Party's Over </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">The IT Spending Paradox </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">11</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">The Information Economic Paradox </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">16</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Trends for Information Technology Providers \n    </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">16</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Extending Asset Lifecycles </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">18</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Consolidation </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">19</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Services </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">19</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Network Services: The Next Big Thing </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">22</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Information Technology Leaders verses Managers \n    </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">24</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">The Solution Providers‚ Plan for Success </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">25</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Availability </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">26</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Security </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">28</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">Accountability </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">31</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\"><b>Section II - Return on Investment for IT </b>\n    </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\"><b>32</b></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">ROI is Now a Requirement </td>\n    <td align=\"right\" width=\"28\" valign=\"top\">32</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"326\" valign=\"top\">What is ROI Analysis?

As result of a lively discussion the decision was made to launch a series of articles that would brief computer executives about terms and definitions that are commonplace whenever budgets and financial plans must consider rising demands from the I.T. organizations for funds.<p>\n\nWe have received permission from the Editors of Computerworld to reproduce the financial terms series in this publication.  Each topic was authored by an expert writer and represented the best understanding on how financial terms relate to the management of information technologies.  The essays that discuss each definition are easy to comprehend.  They reflect the views of experts who are not only fluent with financial usage, but also how the text would apply in I.T. cases. Although there are many available dictionaries of financial terms none of them discuss their relevance to information management.  This makes the Computerworld collection a unique contribution.","links": "","buy_link_bookmasters": "","buy_link_mightywords": "","buy_link_miva": "https://qs1473.pair.com/straz/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Store_Code=IEP&Screen=OINF&Action=ADPR&Attributes=Yes&Product_Code=D9&Quantity=1","status": null}, {"ebook_id": 10,"title": "IT Value Chain Management - Maximizing the ROI from IT Investments (2nd ed.)","author": "Thomas Pisello","date": null,"npages": 86,"price": 0.00,"size_kb": 1323.92,"pathname": "d010v3.pdf","published_date": "2003-08-21","description": "<blockquote>\n<b>Note:</b> We are making this ebook available for <u>free</u>.

Most people answer “Yes, of course - IT value can be seen everywhere.”<p>\n\nProfessional’s computer systems enable them to access, analyze, communicate, and share information efficiently, as well as compose documents and produce presentations. They are connected when they travel and can work at home as if they were in the office. The increase in IT use has not only changed how the individual works but how entire departments work.  Finance has been automated to simplify strategic planning, better manage projects, automate payroll and incentive management, optimize cash management and make accounting closes more efficient. The supply chain has been streamlined to reengineer how we order and manage inventory – eliminating inventory and production issues and paperwork. The HR systems are computerized to streamline recruiting, hiring, performance management and training. Customer relationship management has been implemented to reduce sales cycles, increase selling effectiveness and improve customer interactions. Indeed, IT can be seen everywhere, but is this pervasiveness equal to “value”? <p>\n\nIt would be difficult to argue that the benefits of IT are apparent on a personal and/or individual project basis, but has there been an overall impact to the corporate bottom-line from IT spending? Have the benefits outweighed the costs?  If Value is being achieved, it should be measurable. If there is a return on investment in IT, the results should be measurable in the corporate financials. The results from IT spending should be recognized as enhanced output from less input – a more productive system empowered by IT investments.\nUnfortunately, as we analyze our database of 10,000 public companies worldwide, and compare IT spending (the input) against a multitude of corporate benefits (the output), the results are random.  Companies that spent more than average on IT versus companies that spent less than average on IT where likely to perform equally well. The bottom-line - IT spending alone did not deliver superior returns. Over the past ten years, the analysis of IT spending has consistently shown that it is not how much you spend on IT, but what you buy and how the IT is managed. <p>\n\n\nAs the CFO and board take aim at IT spending, particularly post-bubble, will your organization pass the test? If you are one of the companies that have performed well from your IT spending, it is imperative that you implement a system whereby these returns can be quantified and communicated. If you are one of the companies that have invested heavily with little to show for your efforts, it is time to take control over return on investment planning – before the lack of results takes control of you. <p>\n \nIf you are a solution provider, it is imperative that investments in your solutions deliver bottom-line returns, and that you have a system in place to quantify benefits pre-sale in order to obtain the business, and even more important, to collaborate with the client and assure benefits post-sale.\nThe next wave is less about innovation and more about the maturation of IT investments - the era of IT accountability.<p>\n\nThis book is written to help all IT stakeholders - project managers and business unit leaders, IT executives and CIOs, CFOs and board members, as well as consultants and solution providers – better understand the issues regarding the realization of IT value, and provide the basic tools for quantifying, communicating and assuring superior returns from IT investments.<p>\n\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" bordercolor=\"#111111\" id=\"AutoNumber1\" width=\"357\">\n<tr><td width=328><i>Preface</i></td>\n    <td align=right><i>i</i></td></tr>\n <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Section I - IT Spending and Performance</b></td>\n    <td align=right><b>3</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Challenge of the Computer Paradox</td>\n    <td align=right>7</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Labor Displacement</td>\n    <td align=right>7</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Displacement</td>\n    <td align=right>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Overhead Displacement</td>\n    <td align=right>11</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does IT Matter?</td>\n    <td align=right>12</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Why IT Matters</td>\n    <td align=right>13</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Critical Success: Business Leaders verses Cost Managers</td>\n    <td align=right>16</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Managing IT for Performance Not Cost</td>\n    <td align=right>19</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Vendor Challenges</td>\n    <td align=right>20</td></tr>\n<tr><td>ROI Service Level Agreements</td>\n    <td align=right>21</td></tr>\n<tr><td>CIO Challenges</td>\n    <td align=right>23</td></tr>\n <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n\n<tr valign=top><td><b>Section 2: IT Value Chain Management -<br>\nMaximizing the ROI and Value from IT Investments</b></td>\n    <td align=right><b>25</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Step 1: Calculating the ROI of Planned Projects</td>\n    <td align=right>28</td></tr>\n<tr><td>ValueMap<sup>tm</sup> - Where to apply projects to improve the business\n    <td align=right>29</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Example Business Process Analysis of Engage to Close (Sales)</td>\n    <td align=right>29</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Cost -Benefit Analysis</td>\n    <td align=right>30</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Extending Traditional ROI Analysis: The ROI Dashboard</td>\n    <td align=right>33</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Net Tangible Benefits\n    <td align=right>35</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Realized Benefits\n    <td align=right>38</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Key Financial Metrics of Project ROI</td>\n    <td align=right>39</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Investment (ROI)</td>\n    <td align=right>39</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Net Present Value (NPV)</td>\n    <td align=right>42</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</td>\n    <td align=right>44</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Payback Period</td>\n    <td align=right>45</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible Benefits</td>\n    <td align=right>46</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Assessment</td>\n    <td align=right>48</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Case Study: Risk Analysis</td>\n    <td align=right>49</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-Adjusted Discounted Cash Flow Analysis and the Risk Adjusted Discount Rate</td>\n    <td align=right>51</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Step 2: Project Selection and IT Budget Planning</td>\n    <td align=right>52</td></tr>\n<tr><td>IT Spending Categories</td>\n    <td align=right>55</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Step 3: Corporate Impact Analysis</td>\n    <td align=right>57</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Step 4: Comparing Current Performance and Proposed Plans against Peers</td>\n    <td align=right>59</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Value of Effective IT Value Chain Management</td>\n    <td align=right>63</td></tr>\n <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n\n\n<tr><td><i>Appendix A:  Glossary</i></td>\n    <td align=right><i>89</i></td></tr>\n<tr><td><i>Bibliography<i></td>\n    <td><i>111</i></td></tr>\n</table>","links": "","buy_link_bookmasters": "","buy_link_mightywords": "","buy_link_miva": "https://qs1473.pair.com/straz/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Store_Code=IEP&Screen=OINF&Action=ADPR&Attributes=Yes&Product_Code=D10&Quantity=1","status": null}, {"ebook_id": 11,"title": "Defining and Measuring Information Productivity","author": "Paul A.

Although many of such arguments are phrased as technological, organizational, governance, security and accountability matters they ultimately resolve into questions of economics.  The application of information economics, especially as revealed in the form of corporate budgeting, has now become one of the principal means for defining the practice of corporate information management.  <p>\n\nThe report ranks corporations based on the Information Productivity (IP) index, a metric that I derived to measure the value added to a corporation’s profitability by information-centered tasks. In effect, the IPI recognizes the added value of information management.<p>\n\nThe most important assets of a corporation are people. The management of information needed to support those people now greatly exceeds the costs of capital. If you consider a corporation’s sales, general administrative expenses to be the “cost of transactions, for getting products or services to customers” then those expenses exceeded the costs of capital in the U.S. in 2002 by a factor of more than three to one, according to published financial statements.  Focus is placed on “transaction cost analysis” that has so far escaped attention from researchers because “information technology” has tended to be treated as synonymous with “information management”. Transaction cost analysis offers empirically verifiable answers to many of the questions that corporate executives are demanding when information professionals ask for money.<p>\n\n\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n\n<table border=\"0\" >\n<tr><td><b>Executive Summary</b></td><td><b>6</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Why Information Productivity?</b></td><td><b>9</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Need for Information Productivity Metrics</td><td>9</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Illustrative Example</td><td>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Measures Are Irrelevant for Benchmarking Information Technology</td><td>11</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Importance of Multifactor Evaluations</td><td>14</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Importance of Measuring Productivity</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Relevance of Productivity</td><td>16</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Purpose of Information Productivity Analyses</td><td>17</td></tr>\n<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Measuring Information Effectiveness</b></td><td><b>19</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Defining Terms</td><td>19</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Determining Input</td><td>20</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Identifying Transaction Costs</td><td>21</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction Cost Indicators</td><td>22</td></tr>\n<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Information Value-Added</b></td><td><b>25</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Calculating Information Value-Added</td><td>26</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Calculating the Capital Asset Pricing Model, With Risk Premium</td><td>28</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Free Rate</td><td>29</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Beta – A Measure of Risk</td><td>30</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Return to Market</td><td>31</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Asset Pricing Interest Rate</td><td>31</td></tr>\n<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Calculating Information Productivity</b></td><td><b>33</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Calculating Information Value-Added</td><td>33</td></tr>\n<tr><td>IVA Data</td><td>35</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Information Productivity Example</td><td>37</td></tr>\n<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Exploratory Studies</b></td><td><b>38</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction Cost vs. Information Value-Added</td><td>38</td></tr>\n<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Global Information Productivity Rankings</b></td><td><b>41</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace and Defense Sector</td><td>42</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Agriculture Sector</td><td>43</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Conglomerate Sector</td><td>44</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Sector -

Such data have the advantage that they are traceable with a reasonable measure of consistency over several decades.  Demographic time series also allow making international comparison where they are used almost exclusively to map the transition from agricultural, industrial stages of historical development what is nowadays loosely labeled as an “information society” and sometimes with greater pretense as “knowledge society.”<p>\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the problems associated with the use of occupational information as an indicator of advancement.  Our purpose is to highlight the difficulties one encounters in using headcount and occupational classifications as proxies for assessing information economics.<p>\n  \nThe data presented here should be sufficient to suggest that the most frequently used economic indicators applied in judging gains in productivity (e.g. output per man-hour or sales per employee) or in benchmarking what are the “right” levels of spending on information technologies (e.g. IT spending per employee) are probably misleading.  Employee-based ratios should be always questioned when used in comparisons involving firms or populations that have dissimilar economic structures, such as differences in the mix of employee skills, regional differences in wages, amounts of outsourcing and a disparity in how funds (and profits) are generated.<p>\n\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<table border=\"0\" >\n<tr><td><b>Executive Summary</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>U.S. Information Demographics</b></td><td><b>6</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Defining Information\t</td><td>6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Workforce Occupational Indicators</td><td>6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Supply-Side Indicators</td><td>9</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Uses of Workforce and Supply Side Indicators</td><td>14</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Summary</td><td>17</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>List of Illustrations</h3>\n<table border=\"0\" >\n<tr><td>Table 1 – Management Occupation Show a Widespread Variance in Compensation</td><td>7</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 2 – Employment and Compensation Shares of the US Information Workforce</td><td>8</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 1 – Managerial & Professional Occupations Show Highest Growth</td><td>9</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 3 – Views of Information Occupations</td><td>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 4 – Actual and Inflation-Adjusted Measure of IT Producing Industries</td><td>11</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 2 – IT Investment Portrayed as Dominant Source of Total Investment</td><td>12</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 3 – Personal Consumption of IT Small Relative to Corporate Uses</td><td>13</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 4 – Bank Compensation Reflects Variability in Occupational Ratios</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 5 – Firms in the Identical Business Show Different Average Compensation</td><td>16</td></tr>\n</table>","links": "","buy_link_bookmasters": "","buy_link_mightywords": "","buy_link_miva": "https://qs1473.pair.com/straz/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Store_Code=IEP&Screen=OINF&Action=ADPR&Attributes=Yes&Product_Code=D12&Quantity=1","status": "T"}, {"ebook_id": 13,"title": "The Economics of Outsourcing in the Information Economy","author": "Paul A.

The issue is not a transient phenomenon; the shift from company-managed computing or company-administered information processes to outsourcing is accelerating. The decision when, how, and where to outsource is likely to be one of the few information-management issues that will be coming up for review at board meetings.<p>\n\n So far, there is only one good explanation that fits almost every case of outsourcing information technologies: The outsourcing corporations are trying to return to profitability by cutting employment and shifting of work where it can be performed at a lower cost.<p>\n\nThis document presents innovative ways for measuring outsourcing.  It presents different points of view how to analyze the importance of making make vs. buy decision. An illustrative case provides an example how to address the importance of making outsourcing decisions from the standpoint of the CTO, the CIO, the CEO and a hypothetical competitor.<p>\n\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n\n<table border=\"0\" >\n\n<tr><td><b>Introduction</b></td><td><b>5</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Rationalizations</td><td>5</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Anorexia</td><td>7</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Brain of the Firm</td><td>8</td></tr>\n<tr><td>When Out-Tasking Makes Sense</td><td>8</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>What is Outsourcing?</b></td><td><b>10</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Logitech Case</td><td>11</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Value Chain Perspective</td><td>12</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Outsourcing Perspectives</td><td>13</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Perspectives of Information Executives</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>The Outsourcing Ratio</b></td><td><b>17</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>CIO Implications</td><td>20</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Outsourcing and Profits</b></td><td><b>22</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Summary</td><td>24</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>List of Illustrations</h3>\n\n<table border=\"0\" >\n<tr><td>Figure 1 - Purchasing Constitutes the Largest Cost Component of a Firm</td><td>10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 1 - The Value Chain Defines Outsourcing</td><td>12</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 2 - What is Outsourcing Depends on a Control Perspective</td><td>13</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 3 - Importance of Information and IT Depends on Perspective</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 4 - Value-Added Can be Calculated if Labor Cost is Reported</td><td>18</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 5 - External Transactions are Larger than Internal Transactions</td><td>18</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 6 - Purchase / Sales Ratio In the Global Materials Sectors</td><td>19</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 7 - Outsourcing Ratios Show a Wide Range in Value</td><td>20</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 2 - High Outsourcing Ratios Not Associated with Profitability</td><td>23</td></tr>\n</table>","links": "","buy_link_bookmasters": "","buy_link_mightywords": "","buy_link_miva": "https://qs1473.pair.com/straz/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Store_Code=IEP&Screen=OINF&Action=ADPR&Attributes=Yes&Product_Code=D13&Quantity=1","status": "T"}, {"ebook_id": 14,"title": "Justification of Payoffs from Information Technology Investments","author": "Paul A.

ROI calculations have been a prerequisite for just about every corporate capital request since it was introduced by DuPont in the 1920s and then rapidly adopted by the automobile industry and subsequently by most corporations as models for investment analysis.<p>\n\n The purpose of this paper is to set forth some of the most important principles to be applied when calculating the value of IT ROI. The paper presents a firm-level view of analysis and does not deal with questions how to justify individual projects or how to address the balancing of a diverse portfolio of projects that have different levels of risk or varying time horizons when one can expect payoffs. Those topics will be tackled in subsequent papers.<p>\n\n The important principles presented here are as follows:<p>\n 1. The imperative to present ROI estimates in the context of generally accepted accounting and financial analysis methods.<p>\n 2. The necessity to apply risk adjusted cash flow analysis for comparing investment alternatives.<p>\n 3. The application of the concept of \"residual value\" whenever IT investments are expected to have long-term effects.<p>\n 4. The importance to present proposals in terms of \"Best\", Expected and \"Worst\" cases so that corrective measures can be taken to focus management attention on timely preventive actions. <p>\n 5. An emphasis that every IT budget request requires a summarization of the proposed spending as an investment portfolio. Corporate management will be less interested in discuss the merits of individual projects than to obtain an overall insight in of how and where money will be spent.<p>\n\n\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><td><b>Introductory Remarks</b></td><td><b>6</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>The Role of ROI in I.T.

Classical economic theory has rested on the assumption that it was capital that made growth possible.  If one invested in factories, tools and improved means of transportation, economic growth was sure to happen as labor productivity gained from mechanization and from new production processes.\nThe purpose of this book is to propose a methodology for filling the gap in the ways how corporate inputs and outputs are accounted for.  Instead of leave the term “technology progress” as an undefined term I will explain how the insertion of the concept of  \"Knowledge Capital\" can be applied to solve many analytic problems, such as how to measure payoffs from investments in “technology progress.” \nMuch of what is said about the advanced state of the U.S. economy does not stand up when one shines an uncompromising beam of analysis on actual financial results.  The premature claims that the U.S. has reached unprecedented levels of widespread prosperity are also not correct.  Wealth based on Knowledge Capital remains highly concentrated.  It is limited in scope and can be observed only for a small number of firms.  <p>\n\nThe data presented here should be seen as the perhaps the most favorable perspective on economic conditions.  The Knowledge Capital for large segments of the workforce remains unaccounted for, such as for the government, in defense, in the case of not-for-profit firms, for notoriously under-resourced consumer services and among a rising population of part-time workers.<p>\n\nUltimately all power derives from the control over resources that are identified either by legal rights or, in practice, as a capacity to extract economic surplus value - profit.  “Knowledge”, as an instrument of power is different from all other prior forms of resources, such as control over hunting grounds, agricultural land or industrial capital.  Knowledge cannot be measured by conventional means because it is not tangible and remains elusive.  It is not reflected in the published accounting statements – the generally accepted current means by which corporations report about their assets.  The valuation of a firm’s “knowledge” is also frequently mentioned in shareholder reports but no value ever assigned to it.  In this work we present a practical analytic method for calculating the valuation of Knowledge Capital. <p>\n\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n\n<table>\n<tr><td><b>Economic Growth & Knowledge Capital</b></td><td><b>8</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Measuring Technological Progress</td><td>8</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>The Importance of Knowledge Capital</b></td><td><b>10</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Observations</td><td>13</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Knowledge Capital Issues</b></td><td><b>14</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>How is knowledge a form of economic power?</td><td>14</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Why has knowledge management become important now?</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Can knowledge be measured?</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td>What are the methods of measurement?</td><td>16</td></tr>\n<tr><td>How does knowledge management affect markets?</td><td>16</td></tr>\n<tr><td>What is the significance of the value of knowledge?</td><td>17</td></tr>\n<tr><td>What is a knowledge capital ranking survey?</td><td>17</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Who should be responsible for knowledge capital?</td><td>18</td></tr>\n<tr><td>How do you expect these ideas to be applied?</td><td>18</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>A Theory of Knowledge Capital</b></td><td><b>19</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>The individual's point of view</td><td>19</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The employee's point of view</td><td>20</td></tr>\n<tr><td>The corporate point of view</td><td>22</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Calculating Knowledge Capital</b></td><td><b>24</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation Attempts</td><td>25</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Market pricing of Knowledge Capital</td><td>26</td></tr>\n<tr><td>A Case of Knowledge Capital Valuation: Abbott Laboratories</td><td>27</td></tr>\n<tr><td>How to grow Knowledge Capital</td><td>27</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Knowledge Capital and Information</b></td><td><b>31</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Individual Knowledge vs. Organizational Knowledge</td><td>31</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Knowledge Capital as Manifestation of Organized Complexity</td><td>32</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Examples in Valuation</td><td>32</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Knowledge Capital and Spending for Information</td><td>34</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Why Employees’ Worth Differs</td><td>35</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Investing in people</td><td>36</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Software as Knowledge Capital</td><td>38</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Insights</td><td>40</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Market Valuation of Knowledge Capital</b></td><td><b>42</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>R&amp;D and Knowledge Capital</b></td><td><b>45</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Right Ratio</td><td>46</td></tr>\n<tr><td>KM, IT and Organizational Capital</td><td>47</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Appendix: Knowledge Capital Valuation Methods</b></td><td><b>50</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value Minus Book Value</td><td>50</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tobin’s Q</td><td>50</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Calculated Intangible Value</td><td>51</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Baruch Lev's Knowledge Capital Valuation</td><td>51</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Paul Strassmann's Knowledge Capital Valuation</td><td>52</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Karl Sveiby's Intangible Assets Monitor</td><td>52</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Leif Edvinsson's Skandia Navigator</td><td>53</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>List of Illustrations</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><td>Table 1 - Calculation of Knowledge Capital for Abbott</td><td>26</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 1 - Cumulative Spending and Knowledge Capital Gains</td><td>28</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Figure 2 - Trend in the Overhead-to-Asset Conversion Efficiencies</td><td>29</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 3 - High Variability in the Knowledge Capital per Employee</td><td>33</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 4 - Information Management Spending for Comparable Firms</td><td>34</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Table 5 - Stock Market “Bubble” Valuations</td><td>43</td></tr>\n</table>","links": "","buy_link_bookmasters": "","buy_link_mightywords": "","buy_link_miva": "https://qs1473.pair.com/straz/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Store_Code=IEP&Screen=OINF&Action=ADPR&Attributes=Yes&Product_Code=D15&Quantity=1","status": "T"}]
