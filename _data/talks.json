    "abstract": "The year 2000 compliance issue is challenging and will continue to test many organizations even beyond the first day of the new millennium. This presentation will address the subject of insurance coverage for organizations and how it impacts quality, not only in view of the year 2000 concern, but also beyond that issue. Insurance companies are becoming increasingly concerned about all aspects of the way those who are insured by them conduct business from quality to liability exposure and potential litigation."

The first part of the presentation will show comparisons between Lockheed-Martin and look-alike firms,such as Boeing, TRW and others.  The analysis will show that the central focus of I.T. services in L-M  should concentrate on reducing the Cost of Goods, which include the\\ncosts of Purchases and Administration expenses.<p>\\n\\nSince the primary value of I.T. services can be found in improving organizational effectiveness, the potential gains from further integration with the supply value-chain will be highlighted as the most likely top priority objective for L-M.<p>\\n\\nThe discussion about I.T. services efficiency gains will dwell on the measurement of Information Productivity as the entire enterprise and how I.T. can identify the most rewarding investment opportunities.<p>\\n\\nThe presentation will conclude with observations about benchmarking I.T. spending, especially in comparison with prices quoted by outsourcers.  Emphasis will be placed on the re-allocation of I.T. spending from ongoing operations and maintenance expenses to funds that need to become available for making innovative investments."

This expense, conventionally identified as \"overhead,\" is as good a         representation of the costs of information management as is available.          It includes not only the payroll for the people engaged in information         tasks but also expenses for advertising, promotion, consultants and         information technology.<p>         An examination of how the costs of information management relate to         all other costs of doing business offer valuable insights for a Chief         Information Executive who aspires to be more than just a Chief Computer         Executive. Mr. Strassmann will describe how over the last ten years         the U.S. industrial corporations: <ul><li> Lowered the costs of information management required to deliver goods and services to customers <li> Increased per employee information management costs faster than employee compensation  <li> Lowered information management costs in support of revenues;  <li> Lowered the ratio of information management costs to operating profits;  <li> Lowered the ratio of information management costs to net assets in place  <li> Information Productivity has improved since 1991.  </ul>  While these changes were taking place the U.S. industrial corporations   also showed the following characteristics:  <ul>  <li> Ninety-two percent of firms incurred higher expenses for information   management than for the costs of ownership of their net capital assets.   This makes the utility of asset-based productivity ratios (such as ROA,   ROI or ROE) questionable as a measure of performance;  <li> Only fifty-eight percent of firms delivered a positive economic   value-added (EVA). This makes accounting profits questionable as a   measure of operating results  </ul>  Mr. Strassmann will show how Economic Value-Added (EVA) and Information   Productivity ratios should be used in assessing a firm's effectiveness   in use of information resources.  Emphasis will be placed on specific   planning and financial budgeting methods."

In the face of this accelerating dependency, IT projects often         fail from the inability to properly plan for risk and to clearly         communicate those risks, and their associated benefits, to the         executive level. Every executive must now become fluent in assessing         and dealing with the potential risks from the failure of their         information initiatives since failure penalties often exceed the         cost of information technologies. Risk management, as a means         for allocating scarce resources, has become at least as important         as the purely technological issues which up to now have been the         primary focus of dialogues between general managers and computer experts."

This requires shift to vastly more efficient  architectures that are not fat client/fat server centric, but  thin client/wide band/central utility focused.<p>  In due course the competition between the junkyard and the smartsourcing  architectures will be resolved in favor of network centric  (the network is the computer) solutions.<p>  Strassmann will emphasize that if an outsourcing strategy   concentrates on  short-term cost reductions  for existing systems assets, everybody will be a loser.  The customers for outsourcing will lock themselves into  long term commitments which will increasingly become  economic liabilities.<p>  Therefore, operating cost reductions as the primary criteria for   entering into smartsourcing relationships, will increasingly  lead everyone down a destructive  path.  Viewing smartsourcing as an engine for building  \"knowledge capital\" through innovation then becomes by  far the most reliable metric for judging the merits  of smartsourcing initiatives."

At the Congress his thought-provoking         presentation will address the topic of:  <blockquote>  \"Even superior execution cannot compensate for an inferior choice what to   do. Whether IT investments contribute to increased economic value-added   is largely determined when plans set forth goals and objectives and when   budgets allocate funds, missions and schedules for implementation.   Planning and budgeting are the only time when top management can make   sure that IT is \"aligned\" with the goals of a firm. During planning   and budgeting the risk destiny of IT is pre-set in that it sets in   place the risk. expectations, performance measures, schedules and   major technology choices. After all of these decisions are largely   locked in, the IT organization is not left with too many choices   except how to execute the plans the best way they know how.<p>  It will be the central theme of Mr Strassmann's presentation that   IT executives do not devote sufficient time to the planning and   budgeting process because they are always rushed to proceed with   installation and delivery of systems. Such haste is in most cases   the single greatest source of all IT fatalities.\"</blockquote>"

For decision-makers weighing the need for infosecurity against its cost, the real                              challenge is determining how much  money to spend and when to deploy it to                              effectively balance expenses and risks. In this authoritative session you will                              discover how  the time-tested principles of risk management, as developed by                              the insurance industry, offer the best economic cost/benefit models for                              allocating funds for information security. You will find out why, in the case of                              individual organizations,  insurance practices that dictate the adoption of  codes,                              standards, independent inspection, risk-pooling and reinsurance can also apply                              to information warfare situations. You will find out why policy makers should                              examine actuarial practices and formal risk engineering as cost-containment                              measures. You will also review examples of extortion, ransom, and arson                              insurance policies that will illustrate practices that can be used when handling                              information warfare exposures."

    "abstract": " Business-to-business e-commerce is the next great opportunity for expanding \\n the influence of IT people. Terms such as \"value-chain streamlining\" and \\n \"eliminating work-flow processes\" have crept into the vocabulary of IT \\n executives, as corporate Boards push their IT shops to proceed with yet nother \\n round of huge investments.<p>\\n\\n Whenever predictions of huge savings call for large expenditures, IT \\n executives may boost their standing by offering verifiable evidence as to where the \\n profits may end up.<p>\\n\\n Mr. Strassmann has examined the cost structure of more than 10,000 \\n industrial suppliers.  Since suppliers of finished goods, in turn, depend on \\n other suppliers, he was able to construct a financial model of the \\n costs of the entire supply pipeline, usually involving up to four major\\n layers of intermediaries. It offers an explanation of where the money is \\n spent. At each layer of supply a firm adds to its costs information expenses for \\n sales, marketing, administration, research and development, and IT. These \\n costs, averaging 16% are included in the manufacturer's sales price, thus \\n taking out a big chunk out of the manufacturer's value added.  When\\n each manufacturers' information costs are added up they may amount\\n to anywhere from 25% to 45% of a product\u2019s wholesale price.<p> \\n\\n Thus cost reduction in information management across the entire \\n supply pipeline becomes the largest opportunity for boosting profits. \\n Mr. Strassmann will show examples how the analysis total information management\\n across all of the layers of supply value chain is necessary before \\n justifying an e-commerce project. The greatest benefits will be realized \\n only by those who will have the market power to extract value chain savings \\n and then retain them as profits."

This model offers  an explanation of where the money is presently spent and what costs become  displaceable by E-commerce.\u00ca He will also show how the rising economic power  of global business-to-business purchasing consortia is likely to end up  dominating the pricing of E-commerce transactions when the elimination of  weak competitors takes place.<p> The presentation will explain how an IT executive should analyze E-commerce  opportunities. It will demonstrate that, on the average, 35% of revenue now  embedded in the entire supply pipeline becomes eligible for displacement by  means of E-commerce. The entire presentation will focus on the total  information content, as a share of the final price of a purchased item. A  special examination will also focus on the potential retail savings in  business-to-consumer sales.<p> A partial preview of the topics that will be covered in this presentation  can be found <A HREF=\"http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/netprofits.shtml\">here</a>."

    "links": "",
    "abstract": "<li>Session 1<br>\\nInformation Management Governance:<P>\\n\\nStrassmann uses the word \"governance,\" but he really wants to talk about \"organizational politics.\" He distinguishes between information management and information technology.  This lecture will center on a view that the optimal organization is a federation. In a federation, power is balanced between a central unit and a number of constituent units.  Strassmann uses the constitutional model to develop a seven-layer information constitution. The top layer is global and includes all functions that deal with the outside; the bottom layer is personal and includes all data that people want to keep private.<P>\\n\\n<li>Session 2<br>\\nInformation Productivity:<P>\\n\\nThe primary objective of this presentation is to demonstrate that conventional measures of corporate productivity, such as Return on Assets (ROA) or Return on Investment (ROI) overlook the dominance of information management expenditures in the determination of financial results.  Strassmann will outline a 15-step process for analyzing the effectiveness of managerial, administrative, marketing and all other information-handling personnel.  In this context information technologies are seen as enablers of human productivity and not as investments that explain productivity gains.<P>\\n\\n<li>Information Technology:<p>\\n\\nThis session will explain how one can answer the question whether information technology expenditures are inadequate or excessive.  Techniques for making comparisons with spending by competitors (e.g. competitive benchmarking) will be emphasized and illustrated.<P>\\n<li>\\nKnowledge Capital:<P>\\n<li>\\nInformation management constitutes both a primary cost and the most valuable asset of corporations in the new economy.  However, traditional accounting practices offer no consistent method for incorporating a measure of this vital ingredient.  Strassmann has formulated a set of metrics to surmount this shortcoming and to permit executives, information managers, and investors to make informed decisions and project into the future likely consequences of past performance.  Knowledge Capital provides an operational means for comparing the economic health of corporations from routinely reported financial data.<P>\\n\\n<li>Session 3<br>\\nThe Economics and the Future of Business-to-Business E-Commerce:<br>\\n\\nStrassmann has examined the financial records of more than 10,000 industrial suppliers and has analyzed their cost structure.  Since suppliers of finished goods also depend on other suppliers, he was able to construct a financial model of the entire multi-stage supply pipeline.  He will also show how the rising economic power of global business-to-business purchasing consortia is likely to end up dominating the pricing of E-commerce transactions when the elimination of weak competitors takes place.

Politics largely\\ndetermines whether computer projects will succeed or fail.  Politics is by far \\nthe most frequent cause of a firings of systems executives.\\nThe solution to political infighting is the institution of rules of governance that offer guidelines how to partition the conflicting forces.  Governance\\noffers the means for achieving a balance between centralization and decentralization of business functions.  The techniques for resolving opposing tendencies cannot be learned from books about information technology.

    "abstract": "<p>The history of U.S. industrial firms for the last 20 years can \\nbe characterized by an increasing dependency on outsourcing \\nto suppliers, subcontractors or even to customers.  This phenomenon \\nhas been explained on the assumption that specialists, or lower \\ncost vendors, could deliver contributions to the cost of goods at \\na discount.  Proponents of outsourcing were also relying on \\ninformation technologies to lower the administrative as well as \\ncoordination costs to manage the increased complexity in all \\ntransactions.  However, despite the logic that would favor \\noutsourcing, little evidence has been produced to support \\noutsourcing as a general industrial policy. </p>\\n \\n<p>In this lecture Prof. Strassmann will show results of his studies over the last ten years which have \\ndemonstrated that outsourcing does not consistently deliver lower costs and increased \\nprofitability.  This lecture will be illustrated by the record of General Motors who have increased \\nthe amounts of outsourcing from 58.8% in 1986 to 75% in 2004 while experiencing a steady \\ndegradation in profitability as well as a severe decline in its Knowledge Capital per employee.  \\nWhile the number of General Motors employees was declining, the ratio of transaction costs to \\nvalue-added was rising which raises the question whether GM's outsourcing of I.T. was effective. </P>\\n \\n<p>The presence of the perverse effects of outsourcing have been now detected for a large number \\nof U.S. industrial firms.  Prof. Strassmann has concluded that the key in making decisions \\nabout achieving cost reductions through outsourcing is to also consider the effects on the \\nconsequential gains or losses in a firm\u2019s Knowledge Capital.

Upon arrival, enjoy an optional golf and evening welcome reception including peer to peer networking. A highlight of the event is the Keynote Speaker, Paul Strassman. Paul Strassmann, one of North America's leading technology minds, is anything but conventional; some call him confrontational. Among his assertions, there is no correlation between IT and a company's profitability. But his experience-including IT leadership at such diverse organizations as the U.S. Department of Defense, General Foods, Xerox, and NASA-makes him uniquely qualified to lead the debate.</P>\\n\\n<P>Following the opening keynote, as featured speaker, Enterpulse will present and discuss SOA Perspectives: Improving SOA Governance, Advancing IT and Business Alignment and Improving Corporate Performance. In addition to SOA Perspectives, SOA Best Practices are presented with examples from Comcast and Lifeline Systems. Steve Fox, Editor-in-Chief of InfoWorld will lead Panel Discussions such as People and Organizational Change and Prioritizing and Justifying Your SOA Investment.</P>"
