<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he news that General Motors,
one of the nation's richest corporations,</font> is turning itself
into "the world's largest e-commerce company," (<a
href="http://www.computerworld.com/home/print.nsf/all/000417D5BA">Cover,
April 17</a>) could affect the ambitions and plans of every corporate
IT department.</P>

<P>The nation's top automaker announced that it would move into the
worlds of online mortgages, cellular services and information
delivery. And, it would sell its vehicle-based Internet technology to
other carmakers.  </P>

<P>As is the case with every computer-oriented publicity campaign, the
rhetoric and new profit-promising visions permeate everything that GM
has so far generated about its plans to also become a "new
economy" company instead of continuing to be identified only as
an "old economy" maker of vehicles. The idea is to
"...grow profits, expand relationships, drive up revenues and
the stock market price..." with ventures such as selling
customers GPS (Global Positioning System) and cellular technology
services.  It sounds good and enticing, but I'd like to understand
better how well GM is doing in the automobile business it has known
for 70 years before it shifts into the volatile world of the
information marketplace. </P>

<P>My first take on this was from the shareholders' standpoint. How
well has GM managed its shareholder equity? It's discouraging.  During
a period of recent unprecedented prosperity and growth in the values
of giant U.S. firms, GM's shareholder equity has declined from $23.3
billion in 1995 to $15.1 billion in 1998, recovering to only $20.6
billion last year.  That's why GM may be pursuing the information
business: It needs more profits to boost shareholder value.</P>

<P>With last year's revenues of $177 billion, it would take an
enormous increase in revenues and profits for GM's information
services business to make up the difference between its current
financial results and the spectacular profit growth that some of the
leading information services firms have shown.  For such expectations
to be realistic look at other indicators of GM's demonstrated
superiority.</P>

<P>How well does GM manage its information expenditures?  One way to
tell is to examine how much information overhead (e.g., research and
development; and sales, general and administrative expense) is needed
to coordinate its operations that produce and deliver what the
customers are buying as tangible products, or, the <I>cost of goods
sold</I>. The results are discouraging.  As the table shows, since
1996, the ratio of information costs to the <I>cost of goods sold</I>
has been creeping up from 11.5% to 14.9% in the last three years.</P>

<P>The steady rise in information costs, which can be
traced back to 1990, raises doubts about GM's claims that it has made
gains from imaginative uses of IT, from e-commerce and from improved
utilization of computers.</P>

<P>To comprehend the significance of the 3.4% rise in the overhead
ratio, one must realize that GM's ratio of net profits to all its
costs is only 5%.  Consequently, for GM's entry into the information
services business to generate better profitability, it may have to
first overcome its steadily rising internal information costs.  That
would be necessary before it could hope to reap significant profit
gains in a marketplace already dominated by highly efficient and
entrenched competitors. </P> 

<h3>Implications</h3>

<P>CIOs are feeling an urge to extend their influence from just
tending internal information operations to becoming agents of a
"strategic" repositioning of their firms.  There's no clear
connection between adding information value to existing operations and
further diversifying a company into the information business. My
advice to ambitious CIOs: Don't divert significant energies and
resources into risky marketing ventures unless the fundamentals of the
existing operations are already well under control.</P>
