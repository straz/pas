<font size="+2">K</font><font size="+1">nowing something about
fishing helps to understand</font> what you get when you click on
AltaVista, Google, Ask Jeeves or any other popular search engine.
First, you never search directly for what's on the Web. Of the
estimated 550 billion documents floating in cyberspace, you get a
chance to explore only about 1 billion. You "fish" in compartments
that each search engine has set up, making it possible to easily
retrieve your "catch" in seconds.<p>

What you can find each time you cast your line is limited by the
extraction and retention techniques that give you simplicity over
thoroughness, meaning any findings will be superficial. What you get
is what has already been found by a search engine "spider," such as
pages logically linked to other pages. If others haven't shown
interest in the documents you're looking for, the chances of those
pages showing up in a search aren't good.<p>

The authors' eagerness to be noticed has led to tricks for tuning Web
pages to exploit the idiosyncrasies of proprietary search methods. For
example, I get offers every week to dress up my own Web pages so that
some searches will favor my content over that of my competitors.<p>

Second, you'll never find out how complete or reliable a search
engine's findings are. The boasts about unique "crawling" methods are
only promises, because proof is always missing. Vendor-specific
Web-exploring software decides what's revealed and what remains
hidden. In rare instances, a search engine will locate only the catch
that's further enhanced by an editorial staff that sorts and
classifies the subject matter. For instance, one of the most
frequently visited Web sites, Yahoo, employs more than 1,000 indexers
who place Web content in predefined categories.<p>

Third, existing search engines work off the flawed assumption that
everything must be searchable in one pass. Consequently, you're
encouraged to inquire by using only a few keywords. In some of the
more sophisticated searches, a two- to four-word phrase is also
allowed. Occasionally, you're offered "advanced" options where you can
call for some elementary logic that would sort what to include from
what to exclude. <p>

Unfortunately, this doesn't work well in cases where
the choice of a popular term, such as "Web," yields more than 30
million results, in no particular order. The existing search engines
don't let you play a game of 20 questions, which would make it
possible for an inquirer to interact sequentially with databases. In
that game, when an ambiguous question is asked, it usually takes a few
tries before the query's correct meaning is understood. Then, it may
take repeated give-and-take before you get a meaningful response. No
current search engine engages in anything that would look like an
intelligent exploration of what's being sought.<p>

The Web represents the most awesome accumulation of data ever. But
converting it into knowledge capital requires better retrieval
methods. The shallow techniques of commercial search engines may
satisfy casual employee inquiries, most journalists and certainly all
politicians, but they won't serve the needs of comprehensive
commercial intelligence. As these engines are deployed as elements of
corporate business intelligence, their simplistic inadequacies become
dangerous because they may not find information on certain critical
events that can make a difference in one's research.<p>

If the goal of your knowledge management program is to retain the
relative simplicity of existing keyword searches, most of your
employees will waste time browsing the Web and ending up with
incomplete findings. If you invest serious money in
enterprise-specific knowledge repositories such as sophisticated
information-mining software, you'll still need more tools to fully
explore the Web.<p>

Start planning to buy search software that allows an ongoing discourse
between those who ask questions and those who answer. Finding,
correctly identifying and then deploying superior information
intelligence will be a decisive weapon in tomorrow's world of business
competition. <p>

has been pursued by material means.
