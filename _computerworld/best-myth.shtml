<h2>The Myth of Best Practices</h2>

Is there a best way to spend your information technology budget? The answer is
no.<p>

Excellent companies can achieve superior performance without following any
standard information technology spending pattern. I base this conclusion on my
analysis of the budgets of <i>Computerworld's</i> Premier 100 companies over a
two-year period. These are organizations whose information productivity is superior to
other U.S. corporations' (for details, see CW, 
<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/eval-productivity.shtml">Sept. 19, 1994</a> and 
<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/keep-improving.shtml">Oct. 9, 1995</a>).<p>

The Premier 100 companies don't show any consistent IS budget patterns. Only
one variable clearly stands out: They don't show any trends toward massive
outsourcing.<p>


<h3>A wide range of spending</h3>

The wide variances in Premier 100 company information technology budgets
contrast with budget surveys that provide only an average percentage or dollar
amount for various technology expenditures.<p>

The chart below displays the wide range among information technology budgets.
It shows the median, 25% and 75% points of the percentage distribution of total
information technology budgets. The highest and lowest recorded values aren't
shown.<p>

There's a big variance in how Premier 100 companies spend their information
technology budget. For example, data center hardware spending ranges from below
8.9% to 21.1% of the total information technology budget. The range would be
smaller if there were a best practice for technology spending.<p>

My conclusion: Excellent corporations deploy information technology in several
ways. Many rely on mainframe computing, using older machines. Some spend a
great deal on server hardware and PCs. Some devote up to half their budgets to
systems development and systems engineering, and others coast along on program
maintenance.<p>

Excellence arises from the way management harmonizes its resources, which are
different for each organization. This is why I believe the current fashion of
telling companies what their best-practice
indicators should be, especially as they apply to server hardware, has
questionable merit. Companies are excellent because they have found ways to
differentiate themselves from their competitors. The last thing an excellent
company wants to do is imitate an average standard.<p>

<h3>Are excellent companies outsourcing?</h3>

In a recent article, 
<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/outsource-losers.shtml">
&quot;Outsourcing: A game for losers&quot;</a> [CW, Aug. 21], I
concluded that outsourcing may become a more credible solution to
systems problems if prosperous and growing organizations start
removing large numbers of IS personnel from their payrolls. My friends
pointed out that I didn't definitively prove that high-performance
organizations don't outsource. My analysis, I was told. concentrated
only on companies that lost economic value-added and showed
corporation-wide personnel cuts while outsourcing information
technology.<p>

It just so happens that I have a wealth of information from the Premier 100
firms to test whether excellent companies depend on personnel from outsourcing
vendors.<p>

A good way to predict the IS budget is to simply multiply the number of IS
staff by $171,200. The actual IS budget number will be very close to that
figure in 92% of all cases. In other words, there is almost a direct
correlation between the information technology budget and the IS staff, as
shown on the following chart.<p>

Information staff headcount and the Information Technology budget of the
Premier 100 companies show up as lined up almost exactly on a straight line.
Companies that outsource would show an Information Technology budget, but
without the corresponding information staff.<p>

If any of these corporations were outsourcing an unusually large share of their
information technology, the remaining staff would have to support at least $1
million worth of the information technology cost per person. That isn't the
case for any of these &quot;best&quot; firms.<p>

The Premier 100 firms do selective outsourcing, ranging anywhere from 3% to 11%
of their total budgets. But they retain most of their information management
capabilities as their core competency. Excellence is gained through
accumulation of company-specific know-how, for which company-based
information management is indispensable.<p>

<h3>Implications</h3>

The data from the Premier 100 companies offers a rich source of
insights, supported by verifiable facts, about firms that have demonstrated
superior information productivity. Neither the prescription of best practices
for information technology expenditures nor the presumption that outsourcing is
a requirement for excellence stands up -- so far -- to critical examination.<p>

That should help you better judge what you hear or read about best practices
for information technology spending.<p>
