<h2>Spending Without Results?</h2>

Computer expenditures are definitely up. The productivity gains from all
that spending are definitely questionable.</font><p>

The origin of the term "computer paradox" has been attributed to my
statistics teacher and the Nobel Prize winner in economics, Prof. Robert
Solow. Solow was searching for evidence of computer induced gains in
productivity numbers, as reported in national economics statistics. He
couldn't find such proof and finally gave up the search. The numbers coming
from Washington weren't sufficiently reliable for anybody to figure out
whether computerization or any other influence had any effect at all.<p>

<h3>Paradox revisited</h3>

As an engineer, I prefer measurements that can be repeated, especially if I
know that somebody has engaged in an organized effort to secure the data.
Instead of following economic statisticians, I like to examine the results
produced by accountants and auditors. Annual reports from corporations
contain data about revenue, employment, profits and assets.<p>

Collecting information about what happens to firms in a period of several
years isn't difficult. Obtaining information about computer expenditures is
much harder. The best numbers that are publicly available are the ones
reported by computer magazines about information technology budgets.<p>

I managed to accumulate the annual information technology budgets for 138
giant U.S. corporations; the figures were from 1988 through 1994. This
includes the budgets of firms such as AT&T Corp., General Motors Corp.,
Rockwell International Corp. and Xerox Corp. I estimate that this sample
accounts for about half of information technology spending for Fortune
1,000 corporations.<p>

Knowing information technology budgets and the corresponding financial
performance makes it possible to test whether or not there is a "computer
paradox." If the growth in information technology spending is less than
growth in profitability, then the paradox would be exorcised. It couldn't
be raised as a challenge to the credibility of computer advocates.<p>

<h3>The facts</h3>
I found that at a 67.4% gain, information technology budgets increased much
faster than revenue (29.6%) and profit (39.7%). Only employment spending
lagged, growing only 2.3%:

<pre>
(in $Millions)       1988       1989       1990       1991       1992       1993       1994    <b>Growth</b>
Total Revenues    1,587,648  1,693,139  1,813,275  1,831,029  1,882,909  1,924,456  2,057,344   29.58%
Total Profits        85,321     84,790     73,500     53,366     64,290     91,155    119,213   39.72%
Total SG&A          256,366    275,041    308,246    335,259    346,722    350,125    363,706   41.87%

Total Employees   9,235,000  9,460,930  9,507,673  9,384,409  9,442,407  9,170,737  9,450,434    2.33%

Total IT Budgets     28,061     34,328     37,544     39,955     40,723     42,807     46,973   67.40%
</pre>

These differences in growth rates don't reflect favorably on the
contributions of information technology. Furthermore, the Sales, General
and Administrative (SG&A) overhead-the line on financial statements, where
information technology expenses are normally incorporated - has grown
faster than revenue or profit. If high investments in computerization
resulted in improved productivity, then SG&A should slow down as compared
with revenue. That would indicate the computer payoff in terms of lower
overhead expenditures, which would lead to increased profit.<p>

It didn't happen.<p>

Some of the following ratios explain why:

<pre>
IT as a % of     1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994
Total Revenues   1.77%   2.03%   2.07%   2.18%   2.16%   2.22%   2.28%
Total Profits   32.89%  40.49%  51.08%  74.87%  63.34%  46.96%  39.40%
Total SG&A      10.95%  12.48%  12.18%  11.92%  11.75%  12.23%  12.92%

$IT per capita  3,039   3,628   3,949   4,258   4,313   4,668   4,970
</pre>

Information technology budgets have grown relative to all other indicators
and are greater than profits for 56% of corporations.<p>

Information technology per-capita spending in 1994 averaged $4,970 per
employee; this cost may be the second-largest indirect expense after
health, pension and other personnel benefits.<p>

The increasing information technology cost ratios are giving many chief
information officers the attention they always wished they had.
There is some reason to believe that the relative importance of information
technology is understated.<p>

Local operators are becoming more inclined to acquire hardware, software
and consulting services that don't show up in the information technology
budget. In some companies, that makes the calculation of the productivity
gains from computers confusing enough to further cloud the issue.<p>

Based on as good data as one can get, I conclude that, for most companies,
it may be too early to banish the "computer paradox" to oblivion, despite
reports by leading magazines of its demise.<p>

The only thing to do is to make sure that the rise of computer spending
doesn't get ahead of the gains in profitability and productivity.<p>
