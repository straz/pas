<font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">hile most corporate IT budgets
are being prepared for surgery,</font> consultants and magazines are
ready to cheer up the patients by saying that all is well. They say
that the big IT spending spree that was so typical of the past several
years will continue, regardless of how much the economy will be
hurting. In fact, they say, IT spending will rise faster then ever!<p>

I first detected the existence of explosive IT growth predictions last
fall. A senior researcher from Gartner announced that the growth rate
of IT expenditures will accelerate, reaching - on average - 10%
of U.S. corporate revenues by 2005. I don't usually pay attention to
percentage-of-revenue benchmarks because they vary from 0.1% for
natural resources firms to a New York investment bank that spends 10%
of revenue on IT (spending more than $70,000 on IT per employee). The
idea that U.S. averages would approach by 2005 what I consider close
to a maximum spending limit was so far-fetched that the prophecy
couldn't be dismissed.<p>

The 10% prediction didn't go away. Within a few weeks, magazines
quoted it as the new standard for assessing how well a company keeps
up with competitors. A leading weekly then announced on its cover that
U.S. firms could expect IT spending to rise, on average, to 8% of
revenues by 2004 as a prerequisite for survival. After that, the
can-you-top-this forecasting competition was in full bloom. An article
in a popular bimonthly magazine announced that by 2004, average
spending could be as high as 25% of revenues. Finally, a respected
computer magazine featured a consultant's assertions that average
spending could be expected to reach 20% to 40% of revenues by 2004!<p>

One way to test the credibility of any forecast is to give it a sanity
check. If true, does it make sense? I examined spending statistics for
8,961 U.S.-listed corporations with total revenues of more than $5
trillion. I then projected estimated average IT spending based on 8%,
25% and 20% to 40% of revenues.<p>

The results were astounding. Here's a table of what we would have to
spend just to match the predictions:

<p class=FIG>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
 <tr bgcolor=#FFFFAA>
   <th>Projected 2004 IT/<br>Revenue Ratio</th>
   <th>Median IT Budget/<br>Employee</th>
   <th>Median IT Budget/<br>Total Compensation</th>
   <th>Median IT Budget<br>$ Millions - 2004</th>
   <th>Avg. Growth Rate</th>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>8.0%</td><td>$15,865</td><td>33%</td><td>$10.5</td><td>24%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>25%</td><td>$49,578</td><td>104%</td><td>$32.8</td><td>118%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>20 to 40%</td><td>$69,410</td><td>145%</td><td>$45.9</td><td>174%</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</p>
 



The projected growth rates are based on
my best estimates of current spending levels: IT spending as a
percentage of revenue was 3.6%; median IT budget per employee, $8,609;
and median IT budget for total compensation, 17%; and median IT
budget, $4.7 million. The figure for median IT budget per employee
takes into account the fact that 41% of employees aren't information
workers and, therefore, not significant IT users.<p>

None of the three IT-revenue ratio forecasts is believable. Their
projected average IT spending growth rates of 24%, 118% and 174% would
surpass even the most optimistic projections in employee payroll as
well as any other corporate indicator, including profits, head count
and administrative expenses. Further, the future IT spending numbers
are in current dollars, and IT costs are supposed to be decreasing,
according to Moore's Law. Therefore, it defies comprehension to try to
understand how the amount of actual computing power we would be buying
would increase profits sufficiently to pay for the enormous IT
bills.<p>

When next year's budget plans come up for review later this year, it
may be foolish to refer to spending forecasts to justify accelerated
spending. By all means, spend money on IT if there's a demonstrable
payoff. But beware of those who inflate bubbles beyond realistic
limits. Somebody who's reviewing your spending plans may puncture that
bubble. <p>
