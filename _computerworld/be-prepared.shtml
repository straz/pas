<h2>What's the Best IS Defense? Being Prepared.</h2>

<blockquote>
<B>The time has come for information executives to turn fearful.<br>
   CIOs must become as aggressive about information security<br>
  as the professional spies and thieves who threaten them.</B>
</blockquote>
<p>

Professional thieves and blackmailers, not amateur or prankster
hackers, traverse the global network seeking opportunities to steal
money, launder illegal funds or extort political concessions. They
have an exceptionally high level of technological sophistication. <P>

Information warfare is raging on the economic front. Governments and
businesses seek an advantage over rivals through cybercrime and
electronic espionage. Their targets: information assets such as
engineering drawings, process flowcharts, experimental data, software,
patent applications, test results, financial data, customer prospect
lists, business proposals and litigation documents.  <P>

How will your company's computers fare when they come under attack?
And if you are the CIO, how will you fare? Like it or not, chief
information officers are also chief information security officers. You
must answer for the fragility of your company's information
systems.<P>

<B>Here's what CIOs need to do:</B><P>

<h4>1. Take Charge of Security</h4>

CIOs must accept the security, integrity and availability of their
companies' computer networks as one of their key responsibilities.
That responsibility can't be outsourced. <P>

The office of the CIO must have the charter to collect, analyze and
understand incidents whenever it detects information-security
infractions, regardless of where they occur. The CIO must have the
means to monitor compliance with information-assurance policies. The
board of directors, and specifically the board's audit committee,
should look to the CIO to certify that information-security exposures
don't exceed specified expectations.  <P>

CIOs also must direct their development staff to make information
security an inherent element of IS design. Retrofitting security into
a system designed on the presumption of innocence and honesty is often
too expensive -- or too late -- to be worth doing.<p>


<h4>2. Create Independent Central Security Staffs</h4>

Large companies need a knowledgeable and trusted staff of experts who
can analyze threats to their business and install countermeasures
against information attacks. That includes attacks that ask for help
from trusted insiders, such as employees and contractors. The staff
should oversee the following:

<UL> 
 <LI>Information-security assurance: Informing top managers about
 the quality, robustness and reliability of existing
 information-security capabilities.<P>

 <LI>Security coordination: Making sure the functions that influence
 information security perform as an integrated process, not as separate
 tasks.<P>

 <LI>Incident evaluation: Evaluating and accounting for every case in
 which information security is compromised or suspected of being
 compromised.
</UL>

The security staff must have the authority to review all
information-handling practices and procedures to ensure that systems
are secure.<P>

Companies also need an independent technical review organization to
certify their information-security design practices. Without
independent certification, the danger frequently is that those who
cause information-security exposures won't recognize that they have
done so.<p>

<h4>3. Protect the Security Budget</h4>

CIOs must champion investing a significant share of IS resources in security.<P>

Companies are kept from taking security seriously by organizational
indifference to strict security precautions; competing interests, such
as quickly filling technical positions without thoroughly checking the
personal backgrounds of candidates; and disincentives to security
cooperation, such as making information easily available to everyone.
Security funding becomes a tempting target for executives seeking
money for pet projects.  <P>

Security funding faces two problems: Information security is
expensive, and the payback isn't apparent until it's too late. One
security-minded company budgeted $310 per person to cover the cost of
security: secure ID cards, antivirus software, an Internet firewall
server, secure ID numbers for employees in transit, encryption
software, intrusion detection systems, central security administration
and a security-testing staff. Add the cost of delays and
inconveniences caused by security practices, and the cost balloons to
$1,000 per person per year -- as much as 10% to 15% of workstation
expenses.  <P>

One solution is to eliminate all use of diskettes, floppy disks,
removable disk cartridges and removable hard drives from the network
unless a verifiable and tamper-proof usage record can be left. At
least a quarter of the cost of ownership can be traced to incidents
involving removable media. When a user inserts incompatible or faulty
software, he creates conditions that magnify the demand for support
services. Almost every breach in information security is traceable to
network access via a removable disk.  <P>

Corporate executives sometimes find my information-security
observations unduly alarming. To them I say, "It's only a matter of
time before a crippling failure of a critically important computer
installation takes place. Paranoia -- a state of anxiety that somebody
may do you harm -- isn't always based on imaginary fears. If you can
think of a rival who wishes your company harm, then prudence may be
essential for survival."<p>
