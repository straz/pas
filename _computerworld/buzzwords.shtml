office</u>, <u>zero administration costs</u> and <u>portable open
systems</u>? What happened to chief information officers who bet their
careers on <u>thin clients</u>, <u>defect-free software</u> and the
<u>architecture of information</u>? All those ideas seemed great but
disappeared as fast as they showed up.</font><P>

With the publishing of a thesaurus of managerial fads (<i>Management
Tools and Techniques</i>, by Darrell K. Rigby, Bain & Co., 1998), the time
has come to inoculate IT managers against buzzword-itis. When it
becomes a chronic condition, manifested by frequent attendance at
conferences that peddle such emanations, buzzword-itis can cause
permanent damage to a person's capacity as a decision-maker. Sufferers
can be easily diagnosed: Their incomprehensible presentations suggest
radical instant fix-it schema that call for new funding but without
benefits that anyone can prove.<P>

The rapid pace of technological innovation has spawned an outburst of
verbal gymnastics on how to cope with rapid changes. In an era where
<u>knowledge</u> and <u>vaporware</u> are peddled like detergent, the purveyors of
ideas need not produce any proofs of novelty or value. Proponents of a
new buzzword can rarely, if ever, show verifiable benefits.<P>

Some buzzwords are just new spins on old ideas. For instance, Gartner
Group has coined a new phrase, <u>Zero Latency Enterprise
Strategy</u>, and labeled it "one of the most important new computing
trends of the next five years." After closer examination of what it
means, in terms of rapid and automated systems responsiveness, it's
only a rephrasing of ideas I heard 30 years ago, when real-time
computing was sold to me as the solution to my batch-processing
difficulties. Likewise, the latest ballyhoo about <u>digital nervous
systems</u> is nothing but advertiser-speak about systems
integration.<P>

Buzzword-itis is cheap and easy to spread. The manufacturing cost of
new buzzwords is negligible, as is their distribution cost. Book
reviewers, journalists and particularly consultants are always looking
for a new twist and will readily spread the word. Punchy phrases such
as <u>failure-proof computing</u> or <u>ready, fire, aim planning</u>
are worth a lot of money on the lecture circuit and at consulting
engagements.<P>

So, if buzzwords cost little to produce, enjoy widespread popularity
and can be enormously profitable, why not enjoy the experience as a
form of mental stimulation? Well, buzzword-itis can be harmful &#151;
it has unintended aftereffects.<P>

Let's take <u>just-in-time inventory</u> or <u>cycle-time
reduction</u>. Great ideas. But they will incapacitate your factory if
a truck carrying spare parts crashes or if the supplier's computer
system can't respond.<P>

Take <u>electronic commerce</u> or <u>made-to-order manufacturing</u>. Sounds great.
But they will cripple your company's logistics if an order for 100
widgets is transmitted as 100,000. Take <u>re-engineering</u> or
concentrating on <u>core competencies</u>. Fantastic! But they will
demoralize employees as they recognize that such wording is mostly
camouflage for head-chopping.<P>

Take <u>data warehousing</u> or <u>knowledge management</u>. Obviously useful,
except that the consolidated archives become easier targets for
information crime.<P>

Take <u>balanced scorecards</u> or <u>satisfaction surveys</u>.
They're known to produce meaningless statistics when the participants
tell management what they think management wishes to hear.<P>

According to some theologians, the devil exists because otherwise true
goodness wouldn't be discernible. And so it goes with attractive
ideas. Somebody must play the devil's advocate. Every organization
must find a way to limit the damages from unconstrained expectations
that overemphasize the benefits from the latest technological
miracle.<P>

IT people are among the largest generators and most eager consumers of
buzzwords.<P>

For information managers to be trusted, they must not only lead on the
upside by demonstrating what technology potentially can deliver, but
also protect their clients on the downside by discussing what
computers can mess up if safeguards fail.<P>

<h3>Tell the Truth</h3>

Information technology projects shouldn't be clothed only in
expectations perfumed with the latest buzzwords. Good IT plans must be
accompanied with a thorough venting (from completely independent
sources) about how bad it can get if everything doesn't go as
expected.<P>

The latest disclosure ruling from the Securities and Exchange
Commission requiring companies to state their potential year 2000
dollar damages if their remediation efforts don't succeed as planned
is certainly the right step in this direction. The buzzword <u>year
2000-compliant</u> (a demonstrably misleading claim for most windowing and
encapsulating fixes) melts like ice on a stove when a chief financial
officer must attest what are the likely dollar consequences. I believe
that corporate management soon will follow with similar reporting
demands, as it becomes more buzzword-proof against the presumed magic
of computers.<P>

Strassmann (<a href="mailto:ceo@stacorp.com">ceo@stacorp.com</a>) is
an active proponent of independent verification and validation of the
risks of information technologies.  He finds that the rate of buzzword
creation is directly related to the number of magazine advertising
pages about computers.<P>
