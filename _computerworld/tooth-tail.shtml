<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he "tail-to-tooth" ratio is a
favorite measure of the Marine Corps.</font>  It defines teeth as whatever
delivers combat power. Tail is everything else, such as support staffs
and the Pentagon-based command. The corporate tail-to-tooth ratio,
which I have been watching for more than 20 years, is defined as the
cost of sales, general and administrative expenses to the cost of
goods sold. It can give you a good idea how much overhead (which
economists define as "transaction costs") is necessary to support the
delivery of a dollar's worth of goods and services.<P>


What's embedded in the cost of goods sold is what customers recognize
as the value they receive. Customers don't care how much a corporation
spends on accountants, personnel administration, advertising, lawyers,
computers or executives. But IT executives should care greatly,
because consultants, IT vendors and most government economists have
long assumed that the more IT you have, the lower the transaction
costs. Computerization, they claim, accelerates communication,
simplifies workflow, automates clerical tasks, delivers improved
intelligence, eliminates redundancies and helps integrate diverse
activities. In short, the biggest benefits are lower transaction
costs. So the tail-to-tooth ratio should be declining.<P>


As I've said before, those claims are myths. Yet their persistence
bothers me. <P>


I used the latest compilation of year 2000 annual reports by Compustat
to examine financial results. I focused on recent trends in corporate
costs while companies were installing computers at a rate that was
growing more than three times as fast as spending on all other
business equipment. In effect, corporations were placing larger bets
on the prospective payoffs from computers than on investments in any
other means of production [<A
HREF="growing-bubble.shtml">"A Growing Bubble"</A>, April 9, 2001]. When corporations proposed investments in
IT, reductions in transaction costs always showed up in projections of
"tangible" gains. But from the accompanying chart based on the
Compustat data, we can examine the evidence of what more than a decade
of exuberant IT spending has delivered.<P>

The steady gain in the average transaction expenses necessary to
support the costs of goods and services caused U.S. firms to spend
$273 billion more in transaction expenses in 2000, or 14% more than
indicated by the ratio that worked for the firms in 1990 ($1.91
billion vs. $1.64 billion). This estimate offers the most optimistic
interpretation of what the additional costs were.  If identical
calculations were based on the median ratio of transaction costs to
the cost of goods - which offers a more conservative view of the
situation&#151;that rise would have been slightly more than double
that percentage. The chief reason for the large gains in added costs
is a rise in pay in the financial services sector, where
computerization was most pervasive and consumes about one-third of all
IT in the U.S. economy. <P>

<b>Implications:</b><p>

The past two decades saw the installation of costly information
management systems that promised reductions in transaction costs. But
the numbers disprove such assumptions. The trend in transaction costs
is a telling indicator that will help validate the long-term
effectiveness of IT investments [<A
HREF="rightspending.shtml">"The 'Right' Spending"</A>, Jan. 7]. Given the increased pressure to justify IT
payoffs, this metric offers evidence that IT investments haven't
improved corporate efficiency, since these numbers can be linked to
financial statements on which shareholders, financial analysts and
boards of directors rely. What counts today is what benefits
shareholders. The prescription for that? Create a trim organization
that can make itself more competitive by reducing transaction costs.<P>



<I>In a follow-up column, Strassmann will examine a frequently used
and misleading metric: the IT budget-to-corporate revenue ratio.
