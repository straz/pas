<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he chairman of the Federal Reserve Board</font>, 
Wall Street bankers and assorted chief executives have attributed the 
enormous gains in the 1990s stock market to productivity-enhancing 
computerization. The reasoning goes like this: Computer-induced 
productivity has made it possible to suppress inflation, thus 
justifying the lowest interest rates experienced by the U.S. 
in many decades. Low rates, in turn, have led to rising stock 
valuations.

This way of thinking has been embraced by proponents of the 
new economy. They proclaim that the new electronic technologies 
have been harnessed to deliver improved corporate profits and 
federal budget surpluses that are sustainable for a long time 
to come.<p>

Whether these claims are true has ceased to be an academic 
matter. Economists and Wall Street are debating whether the 
Federal Reserve should increase interest rates to forestall a 
new inflationary cycle. More is at stake than the string of 
unprecedented stock market gains: An inflation-induced recession 
may affect the outcome of the presidential elections. The question 
of whether information technology has improved productivity 
is now at the center of the economic stage.</td>

Thus it was that the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors - 
the most powerful financial policy body in the world - decided 
to devote its April 15 meeting to hearing evidence about 
technology-induced productivity gains. I was one of the 
invited experts, along with senior economists from Harvard, 
McKinsey Research Institute, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and Yale.<p>

The opinions offered to an attentive board, chaired by Alan 
Greenspan, were diverse. With the exception of the presentation 
that correlated purchases of computer capital with gains in 
stock market valuations, all of the opinions were based on 
admittedly inconclusive government statistics.<p>

My own presentation (<a target="new" 
href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/frb-041599.pdf">www.strassmann.com/pubs/frb-041599.pdf</a>) 
reviewed the rising productivity of 1,586 U.S. industrial 
corporations since 1990. The gains could be verified from 
annual financial reports. The analyses showed that much of 
the potential gains from computerization were absorbed by 
the rising compensation of the U.S. information workforce, 
which includes the fastest-growing occupations such as 
computer professionals, consultants and lawyers. It wasn't 
the lower costs of information management but the rising 
economic value-add of U.S. firms that made the productivity 
numbers go up.<P>

Did the economic value-add gain because firms were more 
effective as the consequence of computerization? The answer 
came after examining the impact of steadily declining interest 
costs on corporate profits. Had the interest costs remained 
unchanged since 1990, there would be no productivity gains 
at all. That proved that the cleverest U.S. monetary policy-making 
since Alexander Hamilton should take the credit for productivity gains.<p>

What does all this economic analysis mean for CIOs? Simply this: 
Don't take credit for productivity gains you didn't create. 
Don't claim that your firm's rising computer spending was responsible 
for increased profits and stock market valuations. There's no 
causal link between the two; it would be like arguing that 
rich people are rich because they buy expensive cars. 
The value of IT can be demonstrated only after proving that 
the increased economic value of an organization wouldn't 
materialize by other means. That evidence will be increasingly 
sought by corporate executives. CIOs better get ready 
with verifiable answers.<p>
