<font size=+1>The old ways of measuring productivity don't work;
an Information Age replacement is desperately needed. 
In this excerpt from his new book, 
<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/info-productivity.html">Information 
Productivity</a>, Computerworld columnist Paul A. Strassmann 
suggests an approach every executive should add to his 
tool kit: Measure the economic value produced by information.</font>

<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">oday, we can observe a change</font> that
in every respect is as dramatic as anything that took place when the Industrial
Era was born. During the transition from an order based on land ownership to
economies based on capital ownership, many old institutions remained in place
that masked the transformation. The measures of productivity are similar relics.<p>

U.S. companies only rarely report about productivity, even though it's frequently
touted as one of the firms' objectives. Conventional accounting is more concerned
with the interests of the holders of debt than with the concerns of those who
would like to understand how the company could grow and prosper.<p>

Rare attempts to report on productivity, such as Forbes magazine's annual ranking
of U.S. corporations, measure it in terms of sales per employee. Revenue- and
profit-per-employee ratios are not only inconclusive but also usually invalid and
misleading for making productivity comparisons. For instance, in one mature
industry &#151; food processing &#151; the sales per employee for 25 firms range
from a high of $745,000 to a low of $56,300. Does this suggest that the
highest-ranking firm is more than 13 times more productive than the
lowest-ranking firm? That's not the case, since the company with the high sales
per employee deploys 10 times more assets per employee, pays its employees higher
salaries and purchases most of its packaging and transportation services from
others.<p>

The most frequently quoted indicators for assessing corporate productivity rely
primarily on capital asset ratios such as return on assets, return on investment
or return on equity. The capital-based approach to evaluating the productivity of
firms is fundamentally flawed for the following reasons:<p>

Capital is no longer the most important economic input for a modern industrial
corporation to function. The typical U.S. industrial corporation ceased to be a
capital-intensive enterprise more than 50 years ago. Only 130 of the 1,605
"major" U.S. industrial corporations, or 8.1% of all corporations, had costs of
capital ownership greater than their costs of information management. These were
mostly primary metal producers.<p>



Capital has become a commodity instead of a scarce resource. It is readily
available for a price that is commensurate with risk.<p>



The most important assets of a corporation are the people who sustain it and the
relationships they develop both internally and externally. To compare the
effectiveness of firms requires productivity metrics that consider all of the
variables which influence the ability to create shareholder wealth. True
increases in productivity are the result of an effective combination of many
factors of production, including land, labor, capital and information. Taking any
one input factor in isolation, such as revenue per employee or IT per revenue, to
explain productivity will always be misleading.<p>

We must change the way productivity is defined and calculated. It is my intention
to overcome the defects of the measures based on simple ratios. We will therefore
concentrate on a composite measure of productivity that reflects the decisive
influence of information management along with all of the other input factors.
With capital constituting a significantly smaller influence than information,
what matters now is the productivity of information management.<p>

The stakes are enormous. The performance of the stock market and the prospects of
achieving a balanced federal budget all depend on the expectation of steadily
rising productivity gains. Meanwhile, the presumption that information
technologies improve productivity gives legitimacy to proposals to invest more
money on computers. Much of the current thrust to transfer business
communications to Internet-based commerce is based on the presumption that IT
will offer corporations sustainable new opportunities to boost their productivity
and profitability. Without productivity assessment and productivity monitoring,
it is unlikely that enormous investments in Internet-based commerce will deliver
the expected results.<p>

It is only a matter of time before corporate leadership will be forced to shift
attention to information management as evidenced by increased emphasis on
overhead cost reduction, value-chain streamlining and savings through mergers and
consolidations. In each such case IT plays the key, if not the leading, role in
making a change feasible. To guide such improvements one needs to answer the
following questions:<p>



<UL><LI> Is information technology improving the productivity of corporate
information resources?<p>



<LI> How does one track gains from investments resulting from changes in
management processes and increased employee training?<p>



<LI> What new measures of effectiveness are needed to equip management with
indicators to guide their IT investment decisions, training activities, market
development initiatives and business process improvements?<p>



<LI> Which indicators support motivation to make the right choices and hence,
that could be used for bonuses, stock options and other financial
incentives?</UL><p>

<h3>Measuring Information Productivity</h3>

The computation of information productivity depends on getting the costs of
information approximately right. My definition of information costs is very
broad. It includes all costs of managing, coordinating, training, communicating,
planning, accounting, marketing and research. Unless an activity is clearly a
direct expense associated with delivering a product or service to a paying
customer, it will be classified as an information expense.<p>

Activity-based costing methods are particularly useful in separating cost
elements that are directly related to the production of customer value from those
that are engaged in coordination and support. My approach to determining
information inputs is to first account for all the costs of delivering goods and
services to customers. All remaining costs are "overhead" costs that I define as
the costs of information management. Such information management costs would
include all costs of internal coordination such as personnel, financial and
marketing expenses. Information management also includes the costs of training,
employee meetings and all IT costs that are not included in the cost of goods
sold.<p>

By this definition, the costs of information management also include the costs of
maintaining external relationships such as marketing, advertising, purchasing,
government relations, regulatory compliance and all costs incurred in creating
better relationships with suppliers and customers.<p>

To come up with an estimate of the costs of information management, the data
compiled by stock market analyst research services is of great value. The data is
obtained from corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
well as from published annual reports. Such data has the advantage in that it is
audited, available quarterly and always subject to public scrutiny by investors,
analysts and shareholders. In this respect, such data is far superior to
productivity estimates available from government sources, which depend on data
aggregations and surveys.<p>

With more than 12,000 firms in my database, it is then possible to calculate the
information productivity of individual firms as follows:<p>

<center><img src="productivity-formula.gif" width=318 height=90></center>


(<font color="#009900">Output</font> equals economic value-added; and 
<font color="#0000DD">Input</font> equals the cost of information
management, which is sales, general and administrative costs plus research and
development costs)<p>

"Information productivity" yields a conservative estimate for the purpose of
relative ranking and benchmarking comparisons. Published financial reports are
likely to understate the total cost of information. This happens whenever
overhead is absorbed in the cost of goods sold or in the cost of purchases.<p>

The purpose of information productivity analysis is to shift attention from IT
itself to the effectiveness of the executives who manage it. The key to obtaining
business value from computers lies in linking the uses of the technology to
business plans. This connection must be explicit by showing how it overcomes
existing business problems and how it contributes to future gains.<p>

We have to evaluate the contributions of information technologies in terms of
their effects on increasing the ratio of management value-added to management
costs, which is how we define information productivity. If information
productivity increases as a result of effective deployment of information
technologies, that would be one of the indicators whether one's computers are
producing a business payoff. Focusing on information productivity rather than on
IT will lead to the following improved practices:<p>



<UL><LI> Correctly diagnosing conditions that will improve information
productivity before making an attempt to resystemize, re-engineer or automate.<p>



<LI> Making management more productive before adding electronic means, by first
finding what impairs their business performance.<p>



<LI> Automating only those business processes that are directly linked to
measurable improvements in economic value-added.</UL><p>

<h3>CIO Implications</h3>

If chief information officers are to acquire the influence implied by their
title, they must shift attention from information technology to information
management. In fact, they may have no choice in this matter since the payoffs
from IT can be assessed only in terms of how it affects economic value-added
(which is not the same as corporate profits!) as well as information management.
These two variables just happen to define information productivity. A firm's
information technologies must first be judged in terms of their demonstrable
impact on long-term gains in information productivity, as well as in delivering
higher levels of information productivity than their principal competitors.<p>

Strassmann's Information Productivity &#151; Assessing the Information Management
Costs of U.S. Industrial Corporations (The Information Economics Press, New
Canaan, Conn.; 168 pages; $49, paperback) is available at
<A href="http://www.infoeconomics.com">http://www.infoeconomics.com</a>. 
The book includes information productivity rankings and ratios for 1,560 firms, including a list of 400 firms with superior
information productivity performance.<p>

<h3>Glossary</h3>
<blockquote>
<dt><b>Economic value-added</b>:</dt> 
Profits after taxes minus payment for shareholder capital
(defined as shareholder equity plus accumulated reserves).<p>



<dt><b>Activity-based costing</b>:</dt> 
An accounting method that assigns costs to activities
rather than products or services. This enables resource and overhead costs to be
more accurately assigned to the products and services that consume them.<p>



<dt><b>Return on assets (ROA)</b>:</dt>  Profits divided by the assets employed.<p>



<dt><b>Return on investment (ROI)</b>:</dt> 
Profits divided by the investment to generate those
profits.<p>



<dt><b>Return on equity (ROE)</b>:</dt> 
Profits divided by shareholder equity, as defined by
accounting standards.<p>



<dt><b>Sales, general and administrative costs</b>:</dt> 
All overhead costs (except research and
development) excluded from the cost of the goods and services that are sold.<p>
