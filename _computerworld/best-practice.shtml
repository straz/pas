<h2>In Search of "Best Practices"</h2>
<b>by Paul A. Strassmann<br><br>
Computerworld</b><br>
February 13, 1995<hr>


Making recommendations on the basis of preconceived ideas is easier than coming
up with advice based on evidence. Some of the most prominent U.S. consultants
now parade before their clients exhaustive catalogues of what are, in their
opinion, "best practices" for managing information systems. A recent series of
full page advertisements from one of the largest consulting firms declares that
"... our professionals will start by sharing...what works best for others."<p>
How consultants concludes that their list fits the needs of a client is rarely
open to discussion. I have a large collection of "best practices" from
consultants and professors. Their fundamental flaw is that none of these lists
have been ever publicly validated by any independent measures of performance,
such as profitability or gains in market share. Each list contains different
items, in varying order of importance. Where a list has been appearing for
several years, it changes every time.<p>
There was a time when owning IBM stock, smoking Lucky Strikes, driving a
Cadillac or depositing your money in a Savings &amp; Loan Association would
always make somebody's "best" list. But, if you suspect having acne or malaria,
a good housekeeping manual of recommended health practices will not do you much
good. You better find someone with sufficient know-how to correctly diagnose
what remedy will cure you. <p>
The "best practices" approach allows a consultant to write his report on the
basis of somebody's authoritative check-list. That is quite easy to do,
especially if the consultant lacks operating experience. It can be accomplished
quickly because it bypasses painstaking fact-finding. In contrast, a consultant
who relies on analysis and diagnosis would spend much time examining why an
organization malfunctions and what are some of the characteristics that cause
failure. That is difficult, requires patience and calls for much substantive
knowledge about the conditions in the workplace and in the marketplace. That's
why the consultants with the check-list can price their services more
attractively.<p>
Beware of consultants who claim legitimacy when they assert that they are in
possession of universal insights in how to deliver superiority. These
presumption that someone can compile a generic list of what makes for excellent
information systems is misguided. Every firm is different, every organization
has different needs and therefore every information system implementation must
fit the particular conditions of a particular enterprise. This is why the
current fad of awarding recognition for excellence, based on juries with a
checklist, is insupportable. I have checked the names of the declared "winners"
from a number of computer magazine contests and find that the selections had a
dismal record: over one third were losing shareholder value when they were
nominated and over two thirds found themselves in that position within three
years after the award.<p>
The principal finding from a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the
<i>Computerworld</i>  most excellent Premier 100 companies is that they are
different, in just about every conceivable measure. Their CIO's report to
different levels in the organization. Many of them rely on mainframe computing
using older machines. Some of them distribute personal computers widely, others
do not. Some of them have large IT expenditures per capita, others are miserly
in their spending. Some devote over half of their budget to new systems
development, others are coasting along  on program maintenance. The ones who
have large training and education budgets are not the ones who are most
profitable. No consistent pattern of IT practice emerges from the twenty nine
measures that were collected from the Premier 100 companies, whose financial
and productivity performance for 1992-1994 was indisputably superior to 900
other U.S. corporations.<p>
"Excellence" arises from the way management harmonizes its available resources,
which are different for each organization. The future belongs to those who can
cultivate diversity which adapts to conditions of the marketplace, rather than
follow preconceived theories. This is why I believe the current fashion of
telling companies what generic "best practices" to follow is only a temporary
set-back from traditional methods that call for observation, testing and
validation of results.
