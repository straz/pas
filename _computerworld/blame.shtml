<font size="+2">A</font><font size="+1"> lively debate has been
generated by the recent report "CyberInsecurity: The Cost of
Monopoly,"</font> produced by, among other credible security experts, Daniel
Geer, Charles P. Pfleeger and Bruce Schneier. The vulnerability of any
monoculture -- the central theme of the report -- was noted here five
years ago [<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/ms-security.shtml">"Microsoft a U.S. Security Threat,"</a> Nov. 30, 1998].

<P>While the paper makes the case for Microsoft's culpability in
magnifying security risks, that's only a partial explanation of the
situation we're in. Something must be said about the conduct of IT
managers who have ignored rising security threats.

<P>As microcomputers acquired mainframe power, tens of millions of
amateurs got hold of the capacity to mess up systems in ways that
previously were available only to professional programmers. As a
result, security has now become the main inhibitor to further
computerization. IT management should shoulder part of the blame for
several reasons:

<P><b>1. Abdication.</b> When desktops first showed up, CIOs were
pleased that they could unload the burden of satisfying rising demands
to enthusiastic amateurs whose costs could then vanish into
administrative expenses. Complaints about a lack of service could be
unloaded to where they couldn't reflect on the CIOs' difficulties in
dealing with technological innovation. For example, when the U.S. Navy
and Marine Corps set out to harness uncontrolled desktops, they found
over 100,000 "legacy" applications instead of the 2,000 they expected
to find. Seizing control is now difficult because most of the useful
work is done on local applications and not through services provided
by the Navy/Marine Corps CIO.

<P><b>2. Absenteeism.</b> When computing devices started connecting to
the Internet, CIOs tolerated the widespread practice of jump-starting
local application services with few security safeguards. For this lack
of security leadership, the CIO received accolades from computer
magazines without much accountability for consequences.

<P>Three years ago, much of the federal administrative bureaucracy
became a Web-page development shop. When I got to NASA, I asked for a
count of Web addresses in the organization; we stopped at 2,904 and
4.3 million individual pages. Much of the most effective work in using
computers as a tool for collaboration and communication was done
outside of the organizations that the CIO was supposed to guide.

<P><b>3. Negligence.</b> In the past decade, CIOs, allied with
enthusiastic corporate executives, diverted their attention from
managing the total costs of computing to lobbying for incremental
funds for attention-grabbing technologies, such as client servers,
enterprise systems or Web services. Such projects could be managed as
separate tasks and were presented to corporate executive as isolated
commitments. While concentrating on appealing innovations,
organizations neglected to make investments in the reliability and the
security of the infrastructure.

<P>I blame the CIOs for not making the case for the necessary funding to
implement networkwide security because that would have required the
imposition of an enterprisewide discipline. Thus, the CIOs ended up
managing only what they had a charter to manage, which was a shrinking
share of the total cost of IT. With such dilution of CIO power, nobody
stepped up to impose order on the desktops because that was just too
hard to do, was politically unpopular and was a losing proposition
from a budgeting standpoint. Increasingly decentralized computing
devices were allowed to infiltrate an increasingly rickety shared
infrastructure without any safeguards that might prevent the
inevitable security collapses.

<P>The time has come to pay for decades of unsafe computing. And the
price will exceed the cost of meeting the Y2k threat. Executive
management will now insist on the following:

<ul>
<li> A complete accounting of the security of every computing asset
and every conceivable entry point into an organization's network. This
will include all portals, operating systems, routers, switches,
wireless devices, firewalls and modems, as well as all data entry
applications.

<P>
<li> Certification that there is a 100% enforcement of real-time
authentication and authorization of access to files, to operating
software and to applications.

<p>
<li> Government certification that the custody and retention of all
transaction records meets worst-case contingency scenarios.

</ul>

<P>Through abdication, managerial absenteeism and negligence, we have
ended up with millions of insecure mainframes on desks and laptops,
and in briefcases. Microsoft profited from providing software that can
be best characterized as trying to serve all, at all
times. Nevertheless, the lack of adult supervision and accountability
from CIOs also deserves a share of the blame for the current
deplorable state of insecurity.

<P><i><b>Paul A. Strassmann</b> (<A
HREF="mailto:paul@strassmann.com">paul@strassmann.com</A>) is convinced
that even a palm-size device with the power of a mainframe warrants
data center security measures. </i>
