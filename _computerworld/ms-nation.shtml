<font size="+2">A</font><font size="+1">rguing that the antitrust
suit</font> against Microsoft could hurt the economy, Microsoft has
been taking out newspaper ads stating: " ... the government is
spending millions of taxpayer dollars in a court case that would
stifle competition and interfere with an industry that is responsible
for 25% of the nation's economic growth."<p>

If 25% of the economic growth is somehow linked to Microsoft's trial,
the prospect of crippling the economy warrants attention. What is the
merit of its claim? After all, IT-related employment and revenues are
only a small component of the U.S. economy.<p>

As defined by the Department of Commerce, the information technology
and electronics industry revenues accounted for 8.1% of the gross
domestic product (GDP). Microsoft itself earns only 2.3% of the
industry's revenues. So here we have 0.19% of the economy alleging
that government may be jeopardizing a quarter of the nation's growth
by stifling Microsoft.<p>

Where did the 25% figure come from? A helpful executive at Microsoft's
public relations agency directed me to the Commerce Department's
report on "The Emerging Digital Economy" (<a
href="http://www.ecommerce.gov/emerging.htm">http://www.ecommerce.gov/emerging.htm</a>).
Indeed, the report stated in its executive summary that "in recent
years, IT industries have been responsible for more than one quarter
of real economic growth."<p>

There are problems with the data backing up the executive summary. The
definition of what is "information technology" included consumer
entertainment: household audio and video, radio and TV equipment,
radio broadcasting, television broadcasting and cable and pay TV. If I
limit IT to computer hardware, semiconductors, instrumentation, office
machinery, software, computer services and telecommunications (both
voice and data), the size of the entire industry shrinks from 8.1% of
the GDP and a growth rate of 14.7% to 5.4% of the GDP and a growth
rate of only 8.8%. So that 25% figure is just puffery.<p>

More flagrant is the distortion of the role of the information
industry by using adjusted prices instead of actual prices for making
comparisons. To adjust IT purchase costs to reflect decreasing prices
of computing, government statisticians invented an "information
technology" cost index. That's based largely on dollars per MIPS,
dollars per megabyte of storage costs and similar favorable trends.<p>

Applying fictional indices amplifies the calculated growth that was
attributed to "information technology." Ninety-three dollars worth of
cash spending in 1990 was marked down to be worth only $69, while $112
worth of cash spending in 1996 was marked up to $268. By tilting the
scales, the spending for IT comes up looking much better than the rest
of the economy.<p>

Surely, we're now buying more computing power per dollar. But equating
cheaper computing with economic growth is stretching the claims about
the favorable economic impacts of computers beyond what is
demonstrable.<p>

Though the government included the GDP growth number based on actual
prices, that was overlooked in the Microsoft advertisement. Based on
actual prices paid by customers, IT has made a noteworthy contribution
but a materially lower one than claimed in the advertisements.<p>

The Microsoft advertisement is deceptive on three counts: Microsoft,
with only 0.19% of the GDP, shouldn't represent that damage to itself
could potentially injure the entire economy. Microsoft shouldn't claim
for itself the accomplishments of the entertainment industry. Nor
should Microsoft claim that IT is somehow responsible for 25% of the
nation's economic growth based on fictional metrics when that number
-- on a cash basis -- is much lower.<p>

Microsoft shouldn't selectively use sound-bite statistics out of
context to give misleading information about what the IT industry has
actually delivered. <p>
