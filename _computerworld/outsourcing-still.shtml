<p><font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he most frequent reason
companies turn to outsourcing is the need to increase
profits. Replacing premium-priced labor with workers earning less has
led to lower costs for products and services. That in turn has led to
an increase in the purchases - that is outsourcing - of materials,
components, parts and services by the companies. The value of
outsourced goods and services for U.S. companies now averages 65% of
the value of their sales. This kind of calculation is in the spotlight
because this phenomenon has become the central concern of what's
called the "globalization" of commerce. Accordingly, firms with a
higher ratio of outsourcing purchases to sales would tend to be more
profitable since they would be substituting lower-cost goods and
services from global sources for higher-priced U.S.-produced
equivalents.

<p>A theory that suggests that outsourcing improves profitability
would contradict observations I made in <i>Computerworld</i> in 1995
[see <a href="outsource-losers.shtml">Outsourcing: A Game for Losers</a>]. At
that time, I collected data on 13 of the largest IT outsourcing
contracts. I showed that companies that were contracting out a major
share of their IT spending could be characterized as losers. Their
profits were declining while they were cutting significant numbers of
employees.</p>

<p>To re-examine the economics of outsourcing, I collected 2002
payroll data on a diverse and random sample of 324 companies listed in
Standard & Poor's financial reports. After adding taxes, profits and
depreciation, I calculated each company's value-added. The difference
between sales and the value-added yielded the worth of outsourced
purchases because sales minus value-added equals the amount that has
been outsourced to suppliers.</p>

<p>The results were surprising. One hundred and seven companies
reported a negative return on shareholder equity, which would mark
them as losers. But 217 reported a positive return on shareholder
equity, which would earn them the winner's label. There were, however,
statistically significant differences between the losers and the
winners.</p>

<p>The losers' average outsourcing-to-sales ratio was 25% greater than
the winners'. Eighty-six percent of the losers were outsourcing more
than half of their costs. The returns on shareholder equity for the
winners were clustered around low outsourcing ratios; the large losers
showed high outsourcing ratios.</p>

<p>To verify these insights, I ran an analysis of 466 U.S. banks. For
this homogeneous sample, the negative relationship between outsourcing
and profitability was statistically even more significant. What do
these finding tell us?</p>

<ol><li><b> My 1995 assertion that "outsourcing is a game for losers"
still stood up in 2002,</b> even though in this case I don't propose
to connect the outsourcing of IT with negative profitability. The
current findings offer a managerial perspective on the economics of
outsourcing.</li>

<li><b>My calculations indicate that only 26% of the low profitability
results are attributable to outsourcing.</b> Companies already failing
for other reasons will tend to outsource increasing amounts of work,
thus diminishing their value-added.</li>

<li><b>My findings don't support the frequent predictions that
U.S. firms will tend to outsource in order to increase profits and
thus eventually leave us with a "hollow" economy.</b></li></ol>What,
then, is the significance of these findings for IT management?

<p>First, the decision to outsource IT shouldn't be taken in isolation
and without full exploration of the potential effects on the overall
financial performance of a company. Sure, one can always show savings
by passing IT tasks to someone who can do it cheaper. But IT accounts
for only a small share of the total costs that a company incurs. The
damage from mismanaged outsourcing will always exceed the potential
benefits from anticipated IT cost reductions.</p>

<p>Second, any company bidding on an outsourcing contract should
ascertain whether the potential client is a loser or a winner. There
are many cases that demonstrate why delivering services to losers with
already damaged systems is risky. Whenever IT work is outsourced, even
under an ironclad contract, there is the likelihood that the losers'
damaged operations systems can't be fixed by handing over custody for
critical applications to a contractor. Both the winner of such an
outsourcing contract and the company doing the outsourcing will end up
worse off and in hard-to-reconcile finger-pointing.</p>

of companies when Paul A. Strassman plotted each firm's return on
equity against percentage of outsourcing as compared to
sales. Strassman collected 2002 payroll data for a diversified and
random sample of 324 firms listed in Standard and Poor's financial
reports in order to make his calculations.
