<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he assertion that computers
improve productivity is generally accepted as economic dogma</font>
and is reflected in government, industry and media pronouncements.
Computerization has been credited as a principal cause of rising U.S.
prosperity, the source of low inflation and the engine that drives
favorable stock market performance.<P>

But the problem with such claims is that there's very little hard data
to conclusively support them. Admirers of computerization rely
primarily on anecdotal case studies as evidence of astounding
productivity gains. But such stories rarely hold up as independently
verifiable proof. Such claims are almost always authored by public
relations departments of vendors, consultants or firms boasting about
their high-tech prowess based on well-written anecdotes. <P>

Some academics have generated a small number of studies trying to show
that spending on computers has been extremely profitable. But the
studies are flawed because they base their findings on questionable
government statistics [

<A href="fuzzymath.shtml">Fuzzy Math</A>, Jan. 8] and rely on arcane econometric formulas. <P>

Published financial statements from commercial banks offer perhaps the
best data for tracking recent changes in productivity. Only banking
firms publish detailed data about overhead costs, payrolls, employment
and equipment purchases. Banks are also unique in that their
statistics reflect their total economic value added. Because of tight
regulatory controls, their reporting practices are more uniform than
those in other industries. Banks also spend the most of any industry
on computers per employee: more than 20% to 30% of payroll. Such high
spending rates should give computers every opportunity to demonstrate
improved productivity results, since increased computerization would
figure as a critical influence in operating results. And showing such
a favorable impact of computerization on productivity may indicate
that IT could be profitable for other industries. <P>

To find out if banking productivity has made recent gains, I collected
financial statistics for 497 U.S. commercial banks. I excluded 36 that
had drastically reduced employees through mergers, leaving 461 firms
employing more than 1.2 million people. <P>

The principal indicator that would signal productivity gains would be
the ratio of staff payroll to revenue. Effective IT would make it
possible to generate more revenue for the same amount of payroll
dollars. A decline in this ratio would confirm the widely believed
assumption that capital spending on computers is always more
profitable than paying staff. But the ratio didn't decline - in fact,
it showed a slight increase, from 19.9% in 1995 to 20.1% in 1999. <P>

Then there's the ratio of noninterest costs to revenue, which
reflects the banks' median overhead cost ratio - the sum of
administrative, data processing and managerial expenses - divided by
total revenue from fees and interest. After a decline from 1995
through 1997 (39.1% to 37.2%), it rose to 38.3% in 1999, showing only
an unimpressive improvement over five years.<P>

The ratio of equipment cost to staff payroll (down from 16.3% in 1995
to 15.9% in 1999) represents only an approximation of IT hardware
spending. This indicates that banks continued to spend heavily on
computer equipment and suggests that policies of devoting
exceptionally high levels of capital investment on hardware were
necessary. <P>

This confirms that the much-debated "computer paradox" that MIT
professor Robert Solow wrote in 1987 ("You see computers everywhere
except in the economic statistics.") hasn't been banished. None of
that should be discouraging, since there are quite a few banks that
deliver staff payroll-to-revenue improvements materially better than
the median values. Some 93 banks delivered better than 10%
improvements in that ratio. The extent to which such superior
performance can be directly attributed to computers can be understood
only by studying the quality of leadership, especially in cases where
superior management - and not technology - made the difference. <P>

Be very skeptical of general pronouncements about universal benefits of computerization. <P>
