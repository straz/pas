<font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">ith the proliferation of
business-to-business Web sites,</font> we're witnessing the emergence
of the phenomenon of oligopsony - what economists call a condition
where many sellers encounter only a few buyers. For instance, U.S.
military weapons manufacturers have only a few customers
(governments). So far, oligopsony transactions have been rare because
of difficulties in coordinating purchasing decisions among competing
sellers.<p>

But Web-based business-to-business auctions have changed that. They
offer ideal conditions to operate purchasing alliances. If fully
developed, they'll likely lead to a global concentration of purchasing
power. When that occurs, it will influence how corporate information
technology is run because the alliances will realign the management of
global logistics. <p>

Already, B2B alliances are forcing corporations to re-examine
procurement and sourcing strategies. This kind of turmoil will help
bring the CIO into the corporate boardroom to offer advice on how a
firm might counter the potential erosion of profit margins when B2B
arrangements help lower costs.<p>

But before you plunge into any B2B venture, consider that success will
be increasingly dictated by a firm's capacity to use its economic
clout to get the lowest possible bids from suppliers. <p>

For example, consider Covisint, the online purchasing consortium just
approved by the Federal Trade Commission, representing Ford, GM,
DaimlerChrysler, Nissan and Renault. These five firms account for 44%
of the cost of goods sold ($379 billion industrywide) and 91% of net
profits ($20 billion) of the entire global automobile industry. These
firms expect to realize material cost reductions from their adoption
of Covisint-based procurement methods because Covisint's economic
power will give its members pricing leverage over an estimated 50,000
suppliers. (The FTC and German authorities are still concerned about
potential antitrust violations, though.) <p>

If you're the CIO of Honda or Mack Trucks, you'll have to decide
whether to adopt the data formats, procurement procedures and
information-processing methods, plus a large collection of rules for
the conduct of business as defined by Covisint, set up your own B2B
site or join some other alliance that would compete against
Covisint.<p>

Another example of leverage is the Exostar purchasing consortium of
Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and BAE in the global aircraft
manufacturing industry. These four firms account for 71% of the total
cost of goods sold ($96 billion industrywide) and 62% of net profits
($3.6 billion) in the industry. <p>

It seems that many companies are recognizing that they can increase
profits by joining in a cutthroat auction market where suppliers will
have to rely on pricing and conformity with standard specifications to
win business on terms and conditions that a handful of dominant firms
will dictate. <p>

IT managers should consider these points:<p>

<ol>
<li>The enormous profit gains that can be achieved through B2B
procurement will funnel most new IT investments to B2B ventures while
scrapping much of "enterprise" systems that were only recently
installed as mostly unsuitable to support B2B interenterprise
requirements.<p>

<li>Most of the newly announced B2B firms will disappear. Purchasing
consortia, dominated by the economics of only a few giant purchasers,
will take over.<p>

<li>Unless a supplier has a clear-cut economic advantage, preferably
technological, smaller companies will have to merge to successfully
engage in B2B bidding contests. <p>

<li>The economic impact of B2B on global trade will generate negative
political and regulatory reaction from governments concerned about
their economic sovereignty. Ultimately, politics, not technology, will
dictate the scope and power of B2B purchasing consortia. The alarms
have been sounded already by the European Community, as well as by a
number of Asian nations, concerning the overwhelming U.S. influence in
forming B2B ventures. <p>
