<b><font size=+1>Information Productivity</font></b> - your company's ability to manage 
information - 
is not based on the sophistication of your information systems organization. It is not 
affected by the kind of technology you have or how pervasive that technology is in your 
firm.<p>

It is indifferent to whether you use mainframes or not. It certainly has no relation to 
the size of your information technology budget.<p>

High information productivity can be found in organizations that have a balanced 
approach to management. IT is treated as an important contributor to achieving this 
balance but not more than that. These organizations deal with each function, including 
marketing, production, research, IT and administration, as equally important ingredients.<p>

In an organic view of the enterprise, you can't afford to have any part cause 
malfunctions in other parts of the organization. Everybody depends on everybody else 
doing their respective job to create value. Productivity is the consequence of cooperation, 
integration, learning, shared accumulation of knowledge and clarity of goals and 
objectives. Without these attributes, even the most powerful supercomputer would be a 
wasted resource.<p>

One of the fundamental principles of cybernetics is that overall performance of any 
system depends on how all its parts interact, not on how those parts work in isolation. 
When the efficiency of parts taken individually improves, it does not follow that the 
performance of the system as whole will get better. Enhancing an isolated business 
function to realize lower costs, improved efficiency or some other narrow functional 
objective such as modernization, may degrade overall results.<p>

To increase your firm's information productivity, you must first identify which 
elements of its complex cybernetic interactions are defective. Here are some practical 
suggestions for IS managers:

<ol>

<li>Participate in the corporate planning and budgeting processes. These events are the 
only occasions when all the value-added creation elements that make up the information 
productivity ratio are open to negotiation.<p>

<li>Identify the major causes of value-detraction. Information productivity gains are 
realized much faster by eliminating the negative influences first rather than by initially 
focusing on new ventures or deploying the latest technology.<p>

<li>Start analyzing these deficiencies as if they were pathologies. Corporations, like 
people, suffer from diseases. They have asset sickness, experience marketing myopia, 
encounter broken engineering, suffer from congested overhead, become exposed to 
competitor bites or show customer-neglect afflictions. Each disease calls for a different 
remedy.<p>

<li>Become a valued member of the executive team that is assigned to restoring good 
business health. IT should be seen as part of a comprehensive solution, not somebody's 
idea of injecting the most recently advertised miracle drug.
</ol>

If nothing else, begin to think holistically. It's not technology; it's how you manage 
technology with it that will improve your company's information productivity.
