<h2>The Real Costs of Personal Computers</h2>

<h4>What are the real costs of personal computing?</h4>

The average costs of ownership of a personal computer have finally
made the headlines. Recently, Fortune Magazine quoted the annual cost
of PC ownership at more than $9,000, The Economist at $6,400, The New
York Times at $13,000 and Business Week at $8,000. The most frequent
source of these numbers is the Gartner Group, who will oblige with
estimates ranging from $7,138 to $13,000.<p>

<h4>Talking about large sums</h4>

The sudden interest is due to the prospects of a $500 network computer
displacing a $2,500 personal computer.<p>

For senior executives contemplating NCs and PCs, these conflicting
numbers are bound to cause confusion. A typical Fortune 1000
corporation with an annual IT budget of $200 million is likely to have
about 10,000 personal computers. If you take the highest Gartner
numbers and the low-ball claims of $2,500 for the cost of ownership of
an NC, you have a hypothetical cost reduction of $105 million. If you
prefer The Economist, you could argue that there is only $34 million
worth of savings.<p>

Whatever number you choose, to deliver intranet-run NCs this company
will need, by my estimate, at least $60 million worth of new
development money to extricate yourself from a fully implemented
client/server architecture. That represents one full year's
development and maintenance cost.<p>

Taking these average cost figures at face value can lead to fiscal
disaster. Concocting hypothetical savings based on mythical costs are
a sure-fire way for NC-minded CIOs to get into real trouble.<p>

The fact is that PC ownership costs are driven by how people work and
how they are managed. These factors make "average cost of ownership" a
meaningless abstraction.<p>

<h4>Learning about PC costs</h4>

I saw this in 1991, when I commissioned a study of 32 PC local area
networks while I was CIO of the U.S. Department of Defense. I found
the "average cost" per LAN ranged from $3,500 to more than $60,000 per
seat. Clearly, there was no such thing as an average cost for personal
computing.<p>

<h4>Influences on PC Ownership</h4>


There are two major influences determining the costs of PC ownership:
workload and management practices. Both are shaped by the customers,
technology and applications.<p>

<ul>

<li><b>Customers</b>: The occupational profile of employees drives computing
demand. Professionals devour computing capacity whereas craft labor
hardly uses any. The penetration of computing will also vary. It is
extremely high with engineers and the accounting types, much less with
technicians and salespeople.<p>

Mobile workers require less computing than sedentary number crunchers.
Computer literacy also matters. Employee turnover places enormous
burdens on the support staffs for hand-holding, training, error
correction and equipment relocation. 

For instance, the Bank Administration Institute reports a 50% turnover
rate among consumer credit officers. That staggering instability must
surely increase the costs of all support.</li><p>

<li><b>Technology</b>: Technology architecture and adherence to standards
also influence costs. The choice of the identical versions of
applications and operating systems greatly simplifies diagnostics and
network maintenance.  Liberal Internet access is a killer, especially
on network capacity. 

Without central configuration controls over equipment and software,
one can easily double the staff at the help desks. Most importantly,
there are enormous economies of scale in central network
administration costs. The statistics of queuing theory will always
favor large networks over small ones.</li><p>

<li><b>Applications</b>: The failure of application software is perhaps the
most severe cause of all customer dissatisfaction. Some of it comes
from poor design, insufficient testing of maintenance and excessive
permissiveness for local operators to futz around with features and
options. Removable disk drives that allow insertion of private
software increase the workload for everyone. Strict enforcement of
security procedures and controls may cost as much as $1,000 per PC per
year.</li>

</ul>

<p>
<h4>Cost management</h4>

Though customer, technology and application characteristics can easily
account for thousands of dollars of additional expense for a PC, poor
management explains most of the difference between low and high costs.
You don't need NCs to reduce desktop ownership costs. All it takes are
users and technicians who are reasonably competent at what they are
doing.<p>

Sophisticated network management systems mean very little if nobody
takes the time to assist a few chronically incompetent PC users.
Tutoring and assistance are needed to reduce computing costs, not just
technological fixes. Making users, as well as IS, accountable for
costs is essential to offer the right inducements for cost reduction
and continuous quality improvement.<p>

<h4>Implications for CIOs</h4>

You can't manage PC costs by going after average costs. Average travel
time doesn't tell much about traffic jams. Likewise, there is no such
thing as an average cost benchmark for the cost of PC or NC ownership.
The costs of PC networks will differ for every firm, since personal
computing reflects the unique characteristics of how a firm manages
its computers. I've counted 30 possible PC expense drivers, each of
which can increase ownership costs if managed poorly. The only way to
reduce costs is to uncover the primary causes of poor choices,
neglectful practices and dysfunctional computing behavior.
