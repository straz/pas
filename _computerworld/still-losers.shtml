<font size=+2>M</font><font size=+1>ore than six years ago in this column 
["<A HREF="outsource-losers.shtml">Outsourcing:
A Game for Losers</A>," Aug. 21, 1995], I demonstrated that the real
reason corporations were awarding massive IT outsourcing contracts was
simple:</font> Just about every firm that was outsourcing IT was in financial
trouble.<P>

That column continues to be cited in books and reports that have
addressed the viability of IT outsourcing. Meanwhile, I continue to
field inquiries from CIOs and a few chief financial officers on
whether the original findings remain valid. My curiosity led me to
check on some of the largest recent multiyear contracts for firms that
outsourced more than half their computing resources.<P>

Detailed financial information for 1996 through 2000 was available for
eight such firms: AT&T, Aventis, Du Pont, Nortel, Rolls-Royce,
Sainsbury, Textron and Xerox. Outsourcing deals of troubled firms such
as Enron, which had a huge IT outsourcing contract, were excluded.<P>

Each of the eight corporations that have outsourced most of their IT
also delivered declining returns on shareholder equity (ROE).<P>

The average ROE for the entire group declined from 18.2% in 1996 to
2.5% in 2000. That 2.5% is below the prime lending rate, suggesting
that many shareholders would have been better off since 1996 investing
in U.S. Treasury bonds rather than holding onto their shares. Such
dismal performance is generally considered a reliable indicator of an
organization in trouble.<P>

It's also remarkable that three of the firms that were reasonably
profitable in 1996 subsequently showed rapidly declining ROEs that
turned negative in 2000 - a sign of financial failure.<P>

<b>The Importance of Successful Outsourcing</b><P>

According to IDC, global IT outsourcing (which doesn't include
application services, consulting services, business process
management, network management and desktop outsourcing) will grow from
a $56 billion industry in 2000 to an estimated $100 billion in
2005.<P>

The compound growth rate for such services will exceed 12%, which is
far greater than the maximum projected growth rate of total corporate
IT budgets of 5% per year.<P>

Since the U.S. accounts for about half of global IT spending and tends
to favor outsourcing more than the rest of the world, the projected
growth rate of outsourcing contracts by U.S. companies exceeds 12%.
This rapid increase suggests that the IT scene is likely to be plagued
by two new perils:<P>

<li>Outsourcing services firms are likely to suffer unforeseen losses,
quite possibly from contract disputes, after taking over damaged IT
departments from troubled firms.<P>

<li>Corporations with poor ROEs could be exposed to unwelcome risks if
a major IT support failure occurs during the perilous transition from
internal to outsourced operations, just when there is little room for
error in systems management.<P>

My observation that failing firms increasingly resort to outsourcing
as one of their remedies doesn't prove that the outsourcing itself is
the cause of their troubles. The direct connection between outsourcing
and financial difficulties can't be demonstrated unless one has access
to a great deal of confidential information about things such as
changes in market share, investment write-offs, the effects of
competitive actions or loss of patent protection.<P>

Nevertheless, I continue to find that major outsourcing moves can be a
telling symptom of a company in trouble, as I have shown in previous
Computerworld columns regarding 
General Motors [<A HREF="infogamble.shtml">June 5, 2000</A>], 
Xerox [<A HREF="xerox.shtml">Nov. 6, 2000</A>] and 
J.P. Morgan [<A HREF="dealgonebad.shtml">May 7, 2001</A>].<P>

My conclusions about the declining shareholder returns that are
associated with large outsourcing contracts would be less convincing
if I could show that a large number of firms had dramatically improved
their ROE before they divested most of their IT functions. But so far,
despite my best efforts, I have been unable to find such data.<P>

So I stand by my 1995 findings that firms with declining returns on
shareholder equity should pursue IT outsourcing only if they can
demonstrate provable financial gains that improve otherwise
unfavorable financial conditions. <P>
