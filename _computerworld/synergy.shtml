<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he words <I>synergy</I> and
<I>consolidation</I> are always linked with mergers or
acquisitions.</font> Public announcements promise huge cost
savings. Magazine articles celebrate success. There is, however, no
evidence that the promises are actually kept. I don't know of a single
verifiable case where IT-related preconsolidation indicators were
compared with postconsolidation results.<p>

For the past 20 years, I have been tracking the IT costs of corporate
information management. For instance, in a <I>Computerworld</I> column
in May 2001 [<A
HREF="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/dealgonebad.shtml">"A Deal
Gone Bad?"</A>], I expressed doubts about the effectiveness of
J.P. Morgan's outsourcing deal with four IT vendors. My observation
couldn't be tracked further because at the end of 2000, J.P. Morgan
merged with the giant Chase Manhattan bank, and its reporting as a
separate firm ceased. It just so happens that the combined bank
(J.P. Morgan Chase) restated its historical financial reports to
reflect the combined results. Expenses for "technology and
communications" increased from $2.17 billion in 1998 to $2.55 billion
in 2002.<p>

The following is a comparison of consolidated premerger (1998-2000)
results with postmerger (2001-2002) data. The analysis is based
exclusively on the bank's reports to shareholders and to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It offers a rare glimpse into how
the results from IT consolidation can be evaluated.<p>

At the time of the merger, the bank's top management said, "We believe
this merger will create pretax synergies of $3 billion, $2 billion of
cost savings and $1 billion of incremental net revenue." Most of the
synergies would materialize within two years, company officials
said. A significant share of the savings would come from a
consolidation and integration of information systems.<p>

The table <!-- below --> shows that after the merger, the combined banks had
lower revenues and much lower profits. However, it's the deterioration
in IT-related ratios that concerns me. The percentage of change in the
indicators should reveal if consolidation delivered synergies.<p>

To demonstrate gains, at least one of the IT-related ratios would have
to show improvement. IT/compensation should decline with rising
efficiencies, but it increases 6%. IT/revenue should decline, but it
increases 26%. IT/profit and IT/shareholder equity should decline, but
they increase 294% and 3%, respectively. Every indicator has turned in
the wrong direction. Though deteriorating postmerger business
conditions could be used as an excuse for the declines in revenues and
profits, the unfavorable rise in the IT ratios suggests that the
expected synergies didn't show up.<p>

Claims of IT savings from consolidations will remain doubtful unless there is a well-defined path showing how the gains would be delivered. It's my understanding that J.P. Morgan Chase didn't anticipate the enormous obstacles to achieving systems integration. How much of this was because of "governance" (that is, organizational politics) and how much came from the technical inability to merge the islands of automation will remain a well-hidden story. <p>

The current economic climate favors mergers and acquisitions. In each
case, synergy is cited as a primary incentive to proceed. This is
particularly true when damaged communications firms or hard-pressed
financial services firms combine and centralize IT management. The
federal government has also started consolidating information-handling
for greater efficiency and to minimize the risk of technological
failures. In each case, savings are expected to come from lower IT
costs.<p>

The disappointments from the amply funded and technologically
sophisticated J.P. Morgan Chase IT consolidation should serve as a
warning. The road to synergy is studded with mines. Top executives
shouldn't promise IT improvements unless they have taken the trouble
to understand what it will take to get the job done. <p>

that the best way to achieve synergies is to introduce innovation and
not a fusion of obsolete solutions. </i><p>
