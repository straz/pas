<p><font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">e routinely read elaborate
tabulations of average IT-spending-to-corporate-revenue percentages by
industry.</font> For instance, last year's benchmark for the banking
industry, according to Meta Group, was 5.16%; from Gartner, 4.1%; and
from <I>InformationWeek</I>, 8%. In telecommunications, the numbers
were 5.8% (Meta), 10.5% (Gartner) and 17%
(<I>InformationWeek</I>). Similar disparities can be found for other
industries.<P>

If you have been asked to prove that your IT spending is reasonable,
the best way to answer is to use the highest number you can find. Then
you can plead for more money if your original budget request was less
than what's supposed to be "normal" for your industry. Yet, one CIO
used below-average spending levels (at performance appraisal time, not
budget review time) to argue that spending less than "normal" was
evidence of superior IT management.<P>

The problem with an average is that the numbers depend entirely on
what you measure and how you measure it. The damage occurs when
irrelevant averages are used to justify risky decisions.<P>

In that vein, I believe that IT/revenue benchmarks are irrelevant. But
why have they been so popular? The most plausible answer is that
they're easy to explain. But the real reason has to do with the
changing structure of U.S. businesses. Rising revenues, especially
during inflationary periods, place all IT spending on an automatic
escalator if a firm sets spending levels using a fixed IT/revenue
benchmark. As firms outsourced growing shares of their costs, revenues
kept rising, even though payrolls were shrinking. This way, IT
executives could rationalize more spending, even as the prices for IT
products and services were falling.<P>

The IT/revenue percentage is also a handy way of explaining that IT
shouldn't be driven by economics, but propelled by an "arms race" to
match whatever competitors are doing. To get around financial
justifications, such as ROI calculations, all you need to do is find a
consulting service that would demonstrate that your competitors have a
higher average IT/revenue percentage.<P>

Perhaps the best way of illustrating the irrelevancy of such
industry-related metrics is to pick a relatively stable and
technologically conservative industry sector: manufacturing. According
to Gartner, the average IT/revenue percentage in manufacturing last
year was 2%. According to Meta, it was 3.76%. So, I took a random
sample of data from 74 manufacturers producing similar goods. My
findings? Even though all the firms were grouped into the same
industrial category, they displayed a remarkable range of financial
metrics. Revenue per employee (an indicator of how much a company
outsources functions) ranged from a high of $330,225 to a low of
$45,496.<P>

Transaction costs per cost of goods [<A
href="tooth-tail.shtml">'Tail' Over 'Teeth'?</A>, April 2002], which
indicates the amount of information processed to sell those goods,
ranged from 97.2% to 3.1%. The sales, general and administrative
expense per employee (which indicates the amount of IT needed to
support revenue) ranged from $92,837 to $8,944. So, applying the
IT/revenue percentage as a "normal" benchmark to all manufacturing
firms wouldn't recognize their enormous differences and would be
misleading.<P>

<B><B>Executive Implications</B></B><P>

IT spending is not a characteristic of an industry, but a unique
attribute of how a particular firm operates. Revenue-based "profiling"
based on industrial classification is as questionable as other
approaches based on criteria that don't recognize a company's specific
characteristics. For instance, a superior steel company's numbers
could look more like those of a superior computer manufacturer than
those of an inferior steel company. CIOs should stop taking an easy
(and easily manipulated) path for explaining their spending
plans. Don't ask what others tell you is the "right" spending, but
commit to what profits you can deliver for the company, whatever the
cost.<P>
