<font size=+2>T</font><font size=+1>he recent McKinsey & Co. report,
"IT and Productivity," pours cold water on the widespread belief that
IT has improved productivity.</font> Here are a few parts of the report
that executives might use during the next budget review to knock down
your spending requests:<P>

<ul>
<li>"IT investments did not have an impact on productivity in 53 out of 59 economic sectors."<P>

<li>"The relationship between IT and productivity improvement is murky."<P>

<li>"Except in rare cases, IT did not produce dramatic increases in labor productivity."<P>
</ul>

The report legitimizes a shift from an era of generous IT funding to
one of doubts about anything you promise. If you're watching IT budget
requests for 2002 get shredded, what can you do? Here are some flaws
in the McKinsey findings that you can exploit:<P>

<P>

<b>Productivity is firm-specific, not sector-specific.</b> McKinsey
associates 99% of IT productivity growth with six "jumping" economic
sectors (retail, wholesale, securities, telecommunications,
semiconductors and computer manufacturing), then dismisses
productivity gains in 53 other sectors. But actually, productivity
gains from IT are company-specific and shouldn't be generalized to an
economic sector. There are abysmal failures in the application of IT
among retailers, for instance, yet there are also spectacular gains in
the steel industry.<P>

<b>Even the favorable gains are smaller than claimed.</b> McKinsey
attributes 30% of the value of the economy to the jumping sectors,
leaving the remaining 70% with only small productivity gains, offset
by comparable losses. I found detailed sectoral data for 7,719 U.S.
corporations with total 1999 profits of $417.3 billion. According to
my data, the six jumping sectors accounted for only 16.4% of the
economy. And the inclusion of three sectors is based on questionable
measures. For instance, the securities sector's measure of output
reflects rising stock prices based on investor psychology, not IT
investments. If the questionable sectors are removed from the
calculations, the jumping sectors account for only a very small share
of the economy.<P>

<b>Reliance on federal statistics is questionable.</b> The McKinsey
conclusions are based entirely on contradictory government statistics
regarding productivity gains, as evidenced by frequent after-the-fact
revisions of published productivity data. Thus, McKinsey uses data
similar to what Alan Greenspan and other economists have used to
assert that IT was the engine that would assure remarkable further
productivity gains [ <a
href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/greenspan.shtml">Credit
Greenspan, Not Computers</a>, June 7, 1999]. Only corporate-level
financial reports are sufficiently reliable and consistent for judging
actual productivity gains. Government-issued statistics represent
averages, whereas the effective uses of IT are highly concentrated in
a small number of leading-edge firms. The report doesn't discriminate
among individual patterns of success or failure to make the data
useful.<P>

<b>Labor productivity isn't a measure of IT productivity.</b> The
McKinsey analysis uses an obsolete view of labor productivity:
measured in labor hours per capita or in terms of people employed in
production. Corporations measure IT's contributions based on how they
affect profits. Management makes investment decisions based on cash
flow that includes employee compensation as well as the cost of
capital. Since salaries in sectors such as banking rose much faster
than revenues during the past decade, head count-based ratios are
meaningless. Also, a rising outsourcing of services renders the
man-hour ratios unreliable.<P>

<b>Implications</b><P>

If someone hits you with the McKinsey findings during budget
deliberations, take the position that McKinsey's conclusions are
irrelevant and can't be applied to your firm's conditions. Your budget
proposals should be judged solely on how they contribute to your
shareholder value.<P>

You'll also have to produce credible numbers that show how your IT
spending contributes to profits. You didn't need McKinsey to do that,
but from now on, getting more money for IT will be hard. Accept the
McKinsey study as a warning to prepare for coming budget battles. <P>

<i>Paul A. Strassmann (<A
HREF="mailto:paul@strassmann.com">paul@strassmann.com</A>) says that
despite what he sees as flaws in the McKinsey report, he agrees with
its broader conclusion that IT spending and productivity are
unrelated.
