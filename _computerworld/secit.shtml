<font size="+1">Welcome to the new era of government oversight of corporate IT!</font><P> 

On July 29, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
sent out 9,000 <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/33-7558.htm">letters</a>
to corporate executives directing them to
comply with elaborate year 2000 disclosure requirements.<p>

This is an epochal event for corporate information management. Year
2000 oversight by the SEC is only the opener for further regulatory
interference. Relying on the year 2000 precedent, government
regulators will surely extend their reach into security and safety,
standards for electronic commerce and certification of software
reliability. In the future, many of the key decisions about IT will be
subject to the same scrutiny as originators of pollution, purveyors of
tobacco or makers of breast implants. Decisions that should have been
made by CIOs and corporate executives now will be shaped by lawyers,
government officials, lobbyists and legislators.  <p>

The SEC's disclosure requirements are more thorough than what CIOs
normally would report to their executive committees. Following are
some of what the SEC expects to receive:

<ul> 

<li>An estimate of the material effect of year 2000 failures on a
company's business, without taking into account the company's efforts
to avoid those consequences, such as fixing its software and
correcting its databases. The company must assume it could not be
year-2000 compliant in time, regardless of the money spent or planned
to be spent. Costs of failure include operating losses expected to
result if a company, its suppliers or customers fail to correct year
2000 deficiencies.  <P>

<li>A detailed analysis of the readiness of all embedded systems.  <P>

<li>An itemized schedule showing how far a firm has progressed toward
year 2000 compliance.  <P>

<li>Progress, as defined by the percentage of the year 2000 budget
spent to date for the assessment, remediation, testing and compliance
phases of millennium projects.  <P>

<li>Analysis of a company's year 2000 issues relating to third parties
with which they have a material relationship.  <P>

<li>The cost of becoming year 2000-compliant, including money spent to
date and estimated costs to complete the work. At the end of each
quarter, companies must disclose how much of the total estimated year
2000 project costs have already been incurred.  <P>

<li>Identification of the source of year 2000 funding, including the
percentage of the IT budget used.  <P>

<li>Methods used to secure independent verification and validation of
risk and cost estimates submitted to the SEC.  <P>

<li>A description of the contingency plan for handling the most likely
worst-case scenarios, by answering the question, "What will the
company do if it is not ready?"

</ul>

The 17-page SEC disclosure statement represents what corporate
management should have been asking about the costs and risks of all
their IT ventures. As an intracorporate reporting requirement, what
the SEC is asking is reasonable.  <p>

But because corporate management, IT purveyors and insurance firms
failed to address the potential consequences of year 2000 disruptions,
we will now be stuck forever with the government telling us what to do
and how to manage information systems with a sense of political
accountability.  <p>

I approve of what the SEC has done, though I dislike it, just as I
hated taking spoonfuls of cod liver oil during World War II when it
was the only vitamin supplement available.  <p>

<B>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS</B> 
<p>

One should recognize that the SEC didn't act capriciously. It was
guided by congressional hearings that reflected politicians'
anxiousness to divert any possible blame for failures of the U.S.
information infrastructure. Legislation is sure to follow, imposing
constraints on information management practices. This situation is
analogous to the securities legislation of the 1930s, when failures in
the financial markets induced Congress to create the Federal Trade
Commission, the SEC and other regulatory agencies.  <p>

The SEC Act of 1934 led to financial accounting standards and
certification by independent auditors. It elevated the role of the
chief financial officer. The entry of government into the systems
arena would be positive if it limits itself to emphasizing the
increased importance of IT standards and stimulating the creation of
independent verification and validation institutions. Its most
constructive consequence would be to encourage placing CIOs in
positions of fiduciary responsibility for the custody of information
assets.  <p>

How bad will these SEC requirements be? That depends on how well we
adapt to the new circumstances. Corporate management and IT management
better get ready to operate under the new rules voluntarily -- before
government regulators become enforcement inspectors.  <P>

Strassmann <a

before the Senate in July 1995 that the legitimacy of CIOs would
finally arise from regulations requiring the assignment of
responsibility for the integrity of information systems.  His Internet
