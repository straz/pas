<h3>Governance: The new IS agenda</h3>
<p>
<b>Paul A. Strassman</b><br>
<i>02/27/95</i>
</center>
<p>

<p>Until recently, the dominant model for managing information within
an organization was a command and control hierarchy, where the access
to and distribution of information was administered by a privileged
technical elite. They established a monopoly position over the
production and distribution of that information and dictated how
information technologies were used.<p>

Of course, the days of rigid hierarchy are over. As information
technology becomes more ubiquitous and distributed systems gain wider
acceptance, the democratization of information accelerates. To be more
responsive to the customer and to become more nimble competitors,
companies have driven access to information and decision-making
capabilities deep into their organizations. This transition from
central hierarchies has resulted in master architectures, standard
technological choices and uniform business practices becoming
virtually unmanageable.<p>

How information systems managers respond to these chaotic changes will
determine, in part, how well their companies perform in the future. To
adapt to this new environment, senior IS managers must embrace a new
discipline that elevates the politics of information to the status of
serious analysis. Specifically, they must create new institutions and
processes, including formal "information constitutions," to cope with
the fundamental changes in how organizations manage information.<p>

<h3>Information Superiority</h3>

I have studied the cost structures, technological developments and
levels of computer expenditures of business organizations in great
detail for many years. The evidence is overwhelming that identical
information technologies with the same levels of expense applied in
identical industry sectors with identical competitive conditions may
result in totally different economic performance.<p>

After 20 years of examining the facts, I have concluded that the lack
of correlation between computer investments and operating results is
largely attributable to differences in the ways organizations govern
themselves. The superior performers do not waste people and technology
to conduct mostly intraorganizational transactions but instead deploy
information technology almost exclusively where it creates customer
value.<p>

Therefore, managing IS should be, first and foremost, a matter of
governance and only secondarily a matter of technology. Governance
describes what information management should be all about: the
allocation of control over the creation, distribution and use of
information. Without a generally accepted understanding of the complex
organizational relationships and a means for resolving internal
disputes, an IS manager will divert his energies to dealing with
internal coordination instead of focusing on value-creating external
opportunities.<p>

This new environment requires organizations to distinguish between
information management and information technology management: The
former is concerned with governance, while the latter focuses on
providing technical solutions for specific business needs. Delivering
appropriate information technology is (and should continue to be) the
responsibility of the chief information officer. But in the new era of
fully distributed systems, the CIO typically is not the person
responsible for information management. Instead, every manager must
become an information manager with some say over the governance of
that information.<p>

The CIO should manage the technical aspects of governance such as
establishing standards for open systems or database management. Every
manager who is accountable for business results should be responsible
for the business aspects of systems design and for the operating
performance of information systems.<p>

<h3>Strive for IS Federation </h3>

Of course, conflicts will arise when many managers at different levels
of the organization have say in information management. Information
management among business units and headquarters would operate best as
a multilayered federation. Federation is a form of government in which
sovereign power is balanced between a central authority and a number
of constituent political units. In a federation, central authority is
independent of the units. For example, the United States is a
federation, with the federal government independent from the states'
government yet related through a constitution that balances the power
vested in each government.<p>

Note that federation is different from confederation, in which
elements unite for a common purpose without giving up any
sovereignty. In a confederation, or a league, all authority remains
with the units unless they agree to delegate specific roles to a
collective body. NATO is a confederation because individual states
have retained all rights to decision-making.<p>

Consider IBM's recent vacillation between a federated and confederated
form of organization, which exemplifies the damage an organization can
suffer. Under the leadership of John Akers, IBM reorganized into
independent strategic business units, abandoning the idea of offering
corporatewide systems and integration capabilities. The ensuing chaos
about roles and missions, especially with regard to the handling of
major customer accounts and coordination of geographically
decentralized national units, largely paralyzed the entire corporation
into competitive unresponsiveness and rapid market share erosion.<p>

Some corporations claim to be federations but actually operate as
confederations. A confederation exists when a consolidated corporate
information organization is divided among the individual business
units while a small corporate staff is retained with a largely
undefined and emasculated mission. In this scenario, a CIO with the
task of accomplishing federation goals cannot succeed, regardless of
how much he can influence the optimization of computer operations.<p>

     Federation governance follows the principle that everything not retained under a constitutionlike process is automatically delegated. In a federated structure, computer systems managers at headquarters would concentrate only on those decisions that concern long-term, enterprisewide interests, as defined by the rules of the federation. The accountability for everything else would pass to the next echelon, or layer, which may be a group or division. Likewise, that group or division would delegate lower-level responsibilities to regions, districts, branches and teams. In this way, everyday operations would not be hindered by higher-level interference, and accountability for delivering results would remain unambiguous. Each layer in a federated organization should retain only as much coordinating authority and funds as are necessary to perform the assigned tasks.<p>

I have spent much time preparing organizational charters, conceiving
architectural reference models, drafting statements of principles,
issuing declarations of information policy goals, preparing statements
of responsibilities and generating corporate standards manuals. Most
of these approaches cannot adequately resolve lingering corporate
conflicts. Organizations can resolve conflicts only through a formal
governance structure that ensures a consistency among general
organizational pronouncements, measures of performance and the
division of budgets to correspond with the proposed work.<p>

<h3>A Constitution Master Plan</h3>

The simplicity of the U.S. Constitution is a good template for
information policy guidance. It addresses the governance of
complexity, concentrating only on setting out fundamentals while
leaving everything else to be resolved by means of due process and
institutions designed to continually adapt to changing conditions. <p>

We could adapt the federalist thinking of Thomas Jefferson, James
Madison and John Adams to make autonomous, knowledge-based
organizations viable in an increasingly interdependent world. The
founding fathers conceived a master plan to endow a new nation with
principles that have endured as the nation has evolved from an
agrarian society to a postindustrial global power. This model enabled
the U.S. to be transformed from a monarchy into a layered political
system that continues to rebalance national, state, local and
individual interests. The same model can help IS managers move to a
fully distributed information environment.<p>

An information constitution follows the principle of layered
governance. There should be formal principles of conduct at each level
in the organization. At most, an information governance structure
should consist of seven layers: personal, local, application,
business, process, enterprise and global (see "The Seven Layers of a
Federated Organization," opposite page.)<p>

Of course, every organization is unique, and there is no such thing as
a standard information constitution. But the seven layers will likely
capture all the important relationships within the organization, from
the highest-level intercompany relationships to the relationship
between an entry-level employee and his supervisor.<p>

The objective of information governance is to place the maximum re-
sources needed for short-term flexibility, adaptability and innovation
as close as possible to the local level. Long-term interests -
especially those that require a major, sustained commitment of
resources - should be near the enterprise level for control and
funding. For example, local operators should manage the selection of
report formats and training methods. The design of network control,
information security policies and standard systems design tools
development and data dictionaries should be managed at a higher
level.<p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

Information governance layouts such as architectures for
telecommunications networks, software engineering, systems integration
or data center operations already exist in some form in many
organizations. What I find missing everywhere, however, is logical and
organizational consistency in how all of these elements work
together. Producing an information constitution for a complex
organization requires hard work and a steady accumulation of
amendments and interpretations, just as in politics.<p>

To establish information governance, companies must do much more than
just assign levels of responsibility to businesses, functions or
processes. They must create institutions that are in many respects
equivalent to those found in the legislative, executive and judiciary
branches of the U.S. government to provide a comprehensive system of
governance.<p>

In most corporations, the role of the legislative body is best
constituted within the corporate operating committee. This committee
will most likely appoint a number of subcommittees to deal with
particularly difficult issues such as security, standards, outsourcing
and long-range planning. The executive body should consist entirely of
managers with profit responsibilities who may then choose how they
wish to be served. The independent corporate judiciary role should
fall to the auditors, who must be able to assess reliability and
security as well as standards of performance. <p>

<h3>Questions to Ask</h3>

The first step in creating an information governance is to ask some
very basic questions about what and how information is managed and by
whom. Here are some examples:<p>

     Who gets what data, and who converts that data into information?<p>
     Who balances the competing interests of the policymakers and those responsible for implementation?<p>
     Who will benefit from the free availability of information?<p>
     Who will manage the long-term information management commitments that are essential for delivering information superiority?<p>
     Who will make what decisions? Why, how and when? <p>
     Here are some more complex questions:<p>
     How should my organization deal with the enormous expansion of the capabilities of individuals and autonomous units?<p>
     How does this work when each unit or individual is seeking a unique solution to a problem?<p>
     If working together requires cooperation and compatibility, how do we avoid excessive coordination costs?<p>
     How should my organization stimulate local initiatives while balancing the needs for interoperability and standardization?<p>
     How can information be shared when local operators prefer to avoid disruptive interventions from corporate staff or higher levels of management?<p>
     How should our staff be encouraged to improvise short-term solutions while preserving the long-term benefits of a vast existing organizational knowledge?<p>
     How should our organization establish responsibility and accountability for systems implementation when central control is impractical?<p>

The answers to these questions will result in a new understanding of
information governance and the rudiments of an information
constitution. Of course, the choice of governance principles requires
care and deliberation. Because people will have to commit to live by
these principles, the politics of information governance must become
the politics of open covenants that are openly negotiated, tolerant of
diversity and respectful of staff morale. People, after all, are the
only ones who can make information technology productive.<p>

Information is power, and information politics is the art of achieving and maintaining power. <p>

As companies move away from a traditional hierarchical structure, IS managers need to rethink the politics of information management.<p>

Governance describes what information management is all about: the allocation of control over the creation, distribution and use of information.<p>

GOVERNANCE PRECEDES ALL ELSE<p>

Governance is the art of exercising power and achieving corporate
consensus. Without consensus, IS managers cannot create information
superiority, which I define as the capacity to increase economic value
faster than the competition.<p>

For instance, before senior IS management can align information
technology investments with business plans, it must devise a
universally accepted method of resolving disputes, such as how much
autonomy a division should have. Without conflict resolution, business
units and individuals will persist in competing for funds, resulting
in ineffective, redundant and possibly counterproductive information
technology projects.<p>

Similarly, business process improvement projects cannot proceed safely
if there are too many unsettled questions about authority and business
priorities. For example, does a production foreman have the authority
to modify production schedules to cope with local irregularities?<p>

Governance allows companies to optimize the allocation of IS
resources. And without governance, there can be no operational
excellence. Resources will be wasted on nonvalue-added procedures,
costs will go up, and productivity will suffer. The simpler the
governance framework, the more likely workable systems solutions can
be developed.<p>

     THE SEVEN LAYERS OF A FEDERATED ORGANIZATION<p>

All organizations have distinct layers similar to the federal, state
and local layers of the U.S. government. As in a layered federalist
government, a layered organization should have a constitution, laws,
policies and a judicial system to provide a framework for how
employees should act and interact.<p>

     At most, any organization can be represented in seven layers:<p>

     <li>The personal layer deals with all data that individuals may want to keep private, unless that privacy conflicts with the principles of the business.<p>

     <li>The local layer covers features unique to individuals, including report generation and processing of inquiries, for which higher-level standard processes are inadequate.<p>

     <li>The application layer deals with all features that support the specific operating needs of groups performing similar tasks, such as billing, inventory management and customer service.<p>

     <li>The business layer refers to all systems that are unique to the products or services delivered by an organizational unit, such as a consumer electronics division.<p>

     <li>The process layer covers all functions shared by different business functions and locations. Processes cut horizontally across functions such as advertising, finance and personnel.<p>

     <li>The enterprise layer deals with all services and standards that define the rules of governance for the organization's internal information systems.<p>

     <li>The global layer captures all functions, services and standards that ensure the interoperability of the enterprise with suppliers, customers and technology vendors.<p>

A comprehensive system of governance calls for the creation of
institutions that are equivalent to those found in the legislative,
executive and judiciary branches of the U.S. government.<p>
