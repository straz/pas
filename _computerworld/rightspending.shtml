<font size=+2>I</font><font size=+1>n 1986, General Motors' top
management became alarmed about escalating IT costs.</font> To
benchmark IT spending against Ford, GM hired me as a consultant to
deliver an IT-to-revenue ratio comparable to Ford's, whose IT budget
was reportedly smaller than GM's.  It took me a while to convince GM
that overall revenue wasn't a reliable basis for reaching valid
conclusions as to whether GM was overspending or underspending on IT
compared with Ford. In those days, Ford, with less revenue, was
outsourcing more of its production costs than GM was.  Therefore, Ford
would theoretically require fewer employees to make a car and consume
fewer IT resources to support its workforce. After adjusting for each
company's employment, salaries, the amount of outsourcing and total
assets under management, I delivered a report that was used to realign
some of GM's IT spending.<p>

During the current economic downturn and IT budget crunch, some
executive will likely come up with a consultant's average
IT-to-revenue ratio for your industry, then ask you to match it. In
the chart below, I have included numbers from the year 2000 for Ford
and GM to illustrate how you might want to deal with such a simplistic
challenge.<p>

As the chart shows, Ford's and GM's revenues and employment are alike,
and therefore, their IT spending should be close if you apply either a
revenue- or spending-per-employee ratio. But their IT budgets are
different because their financial and employment structures are
different. GM's estimated IT expenditures are approximately twice
those of Ford's! <p>

In 2000, GM purchased a larger share of its subassemblies, parts,
components and IT than Ford did. Therefore, GM ought to employ fewer
IT resources to manage operations. But that didn't happen because GM's
estimated information costs - such as sales, general and
administrative expenses - relative to its costs of goods sold are
much larger than Ford's. This difference is important because IT
budgets can be best explained not by corporate revenues but by other
factors, such as total information costs (which include IT spending),
plus the salaries of all IT users. Information costs include the
purchase of services from consultants, outsourcing contractors,
advertising agencies, law firms and accountants to support the
internal information workforce. GM's presumed advantage from its
greater reliance on outsourcing is overwhelmed by a larger information
workforce that almost certainly will generate more demand for IT.<p>

There are other indicators to consider. For instance, what are the
differences in growth rates? Here, GM is at a disadvantage. Ford's
1991-2000 revenue growth was twice that of GM's, but Ford's
information cost to value-added ratio remained level, while GM's grew
34%. What matters is the difference in profits. As the chart shows,
the automakers reported starkly different profits over a decade.<p>

Taking into account all the relevant financial indicators, GM's much
higher IT spending is about what I would expect. What is, then, the
"right" IT budget for GM, or any corporation? That can't be answered
by having GM match Ford's spending. The answer is to define a
corporate structure that delivers superior profits, then realigning IT
spending to support that.<p>

<h3>Implications</h3>

CIOs will be pressed to produce credible benchmarks to prove that IT
costs are either in line with or lower than those of competitors. The
"expected" level of IT expenditures is determined by factors such as
the ratio of information workers to the total workforce; the
composition of the information workforce (such as clerical vs.
professional workers); growth in corporate profits; dependency on
purchases from suppliers; the value of assets under management; and
the number of PC users supported. The "right" IT budget, then, is one
that's less than those of your chief competitors, while your firm
delivers superior shareholder returns. <p>
