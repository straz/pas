<h2>Quality Is the Answer to the Labor 'Crisis'</h2>

<font size="+3">T</font><font size="+1">he shortage of systems personnel is a temporary phenomenon.</font><p>

<P> A historical study of all shortages - whether they were for food,
gold, oil, land or fish - teaches us that they are aberrations caused
mostly by temporarily excessive demand.<p>

<P> The economics of rising prices will always generate corrective
measures that ultimately deliver a sufficient supply.<p>

<h3>Shortage and self-interest</h3>

Vendors are happy about any "shortages" because they make selling
easier and prices higher. The recent discovery that there was a
shortage of systems and programming personnel was welcomed by just
about everyone who stands to benefit from it.<p>

For example, the Information Technology Association of America, a
trade organization that represents primarily the computer industry,
favors more liberal immigration quotas for computer experts. The
National Research Council and the Computer Research Association, both
of which mostly reflect the views of academia, favor more subsidies
for computer departments. The Software Publishers Association, which
represents lobbies for Microsoft, Oracle and others, advocates
spending public money to boost the supply of programmers. Computer
people love the news about scarcity of talent because it enhances
their sense of importance and legitimizes requests for
larger-than-average raises.<p>

For someone aspiring to become a computer professional, enter the
head-hunting business or form a software company, it would be useful
to understand how real and sustainable the current shortages are.<p>

<h3>Shortages Don't Last</h3>

There's a simple way to eliminate shortages: cut waste and improve
productivity. There's no lack of examples.<p>

Every few years New York runs into alarming water shortfalls because
much of its supply goes to waste from leaking pipes and poor supply
management. The land-rich Soviet Union experienced chronic shortages
of food while most of the crops were left rotting in fertile fields.
Only 15 years ago, the price of gold was expected to rise to more than
$1,000 an ounce on account of shortages. Speculators lost money when a
drop in demand brought the price down to less than a quarter of what
was expected.<p>

The yesteryear scarcities of oil were supposed to lead to prices of
more than $100 a barrel. Nowadays, oil costs less, in real dollars,
than when the scarcity scare started. The food famines and fuel
shortages that were accepted as a reliable prediction in the 1960s
have now been replaced by surpluses in all raw materials, with prices
dropping relative to the rising global personal income.<p>

There are many reasons to believe that the IT labor "crisis" will
follow this pattern: resistance to rising labor costs, automation of
programming tasks, standardization of applications, adoption of total
quality methods, institution of systems engineering disciplines and
certification requirements. Management will resist hiring more systems
professionals as the solution to their problems. Instead, they will
start boosting ways to deliver greater productivity through improved
software quality.<p>

<h3>The Demand-Management Proponents </h3>

Early this year, a task force report focused on how software
productivity and quality relates to the U.S. information technology
workforce shortage. Howard Rubin, chairman of the computer science
department at Hunter College in New York, chaired and authored that
effort, which included contributions from other software quality
luminaries such as Barry Boehm, Jerry Grochow and Capers Jones.<p>

The report concluded that U.S. software productivity is unsatisfactory
and that it has been declining since 1993. The management of software
continues to be unacceptable, with only 6% of organizations meeting
the criteria of having "defined" software management processes in
place. The report's authors concluded that increasing software
quality, as well as reducing the "destructive feedback loop" from
excessive employee turnover, would relieve the current tendency to
compensate for unsatisfactory performance by adding more people.<p>

Contributors to the software quality and productivity report favor
increasing the supply of skilled systems personnel. But they also
identify the following practices that are necessary to achieve greater
efficiencies: software reuse, systems integration standards that
aren't vendor-specific, simulation methods for capture of customer
requirements, and formal software testing processes and certification
of software for conformity with generally accepted standards. Of those
measures, the reuse of high-quality software components would yield,
by far, the highest cost-reduction potential.<p>

<h3>Implications for Management</h3>

Rising prices, short technology life and chronic systems failures are
rapidly reducing executive tolerance for waste. Boards of directors
are recognizing that the current shortages of qualified systems
personnel are largely self-inflicted, with the year 2000 fiasco
offering the most immediate proof of software mismanagement.<p>

The prevailing waste in managing software as a corporate asset is
scandalous. According to a study by Jones, chairman of Software
Productivity Research, Inc. in Burlington, Mass., canceled projects
consume more than 15% of all software efforts. Furthermore, about 60%
of the U.S. software workforce is engaged in fixing errors that are
largely avoidable if total quality management practices were applied.<p>

If those numbers are correct, proper software management practices
could lead to more than a 1 million personnel surplus. Therefore, I
don't believe that we suffer from a 350,000-person shortage, as has
been alleged by those who are looking for more billable bodies to cure
a situation that has been caused by mismanagement of valuable people.<p>

The present shortages of systems personnel in the U.S. will vanish as
normal growth, global competition and improved systems management
practices alter the current conditions. That will happen within the
next decade, for sure. One should not count on the persistence of
premium prices and the imbalance between demand and supply to make
decisions that bank on that flawed assumption.<p>

certification of reusable software components to high-quality
standards will displace large amounts of handcrafted programming.
