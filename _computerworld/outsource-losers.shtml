<h2>Outsourcing: A Game for Losers</h2>

Outsourcing most of a corporation's I.T. budget is more like an emetic than a
miracle cure.<p>
<p>
Despite all of the reasons offered in the press, so far there is only one good
explanation that fits almost every case of large-scale outsourcing. The
outsourcing corporations are trying to return to profitability by cutting
employment. One way of achieving this objective is by ending their commitment
to keeping up a home-grown capacity to master the introduction and maintenance
of information technologies.

<h3>The Puzzle</h3>

I did not start out thinking that way. What I read in the magazines about
letting professional firms manage the modernization of I.T. was entirely
plausible. But, I was also personally acquainted with two huge outsourcing
contracts which crippled information management for years and made the
companies unable  to respond to competitive encroachments.<p>

Announcements about the dismissal or transfer of computer personnel feature
imaginative stories about why a function that was previously seen as critical
success factor can now be reassigned to outsiders. Some corporations claim
their I.T. has ceased to be a "core competency." For others, the divestment of
"commodity" functions make it possible to concentrate on "strategic" systems.
One also hears that outsourcing is preferable because contractors offer
technical expertise which the firm can't support. <p>

Should top management view massive outsourcing of I.T. as a new and imaginative
way of obtaining I.T. services, or, as an excuse for getting rid of
responsibilities they have been unable to fulfill?

<h3>The Search</h3>

If outsourcing is indeed done for reasons of strategic fit, to realize lower
costs, to take advantage of specialization of vendors or to overcome the
unavailability of technical expertise, then one would expect outsourcing would
be randomly distributed throughout the Fortune 1000 corporations. Outsourcing
should be an equally good rationale to everyone for parting with their in-house
I.T. function. Its incidence would be found in corporations without regard to
size, industry, assets, profitability or growth, as each corporation finds that
one or more of the many claimed benefits satisfies its needs.<p>


Statistical analysis could show whether outsourcing is a random, evenly spread
phenomenon, or, clustered around some causal connection. To examine that
proposition <p>

I asked a librarian to assemble a list of commercial companies which were most
frequently mentioned in the trade press about their outsourcing actions. With
this list, I searched in my productivity database which includes data about
operating performance of U.S. corporations, as well as their I.T. budgets. With
that I set out to determine if there were no discernible unique characteristics
among corporations which chose to outsource most of their I.T. functions.

<h3>The Findings</h3>

I ran many statistical tests that all showed that the occurrence of outsourcing
was not a random phenomenon. The most revealing analysis displayed the Economic
Value-Added (EVA<font size="-2">(TM)</font>), which is profit-after-tax minus 
compensation to shareholders for equity capital. For each corporation that 
outsourced most of its I.T. budget I listed EVA values for one, two and three 
years prior to awarding their major outsourcing contract:

Those
corporations which outsourced heavily were economic losers heading into the
outsourcing act. They were shedding I.T. along with other corporate functions
because they were in financial trouble. I could not find any corporation with a
consistently large Economic Value-Added and rising employment which outsourced,
despite all of the claims about "synergy" or "advantages of getting rid of
commodity work." The losers were casting off I.T. because they were already
shrinking their firm, as illustrated in the following table:

If
outsourcing truly had all of the advertised advantages, economically prosperous
and growing companies would use it because they were unable to absorb a
sufficient number of computer people into their expanding businesses. The
winners also would be the most anxious to secure ready-made technical expertise
so that they could concentrate on their "core" competencies. I could not find
any.

<h3>The Implications</h3>

Outsourcing is in reality only one aspect of a currently popular downsizing
trend among troubled corporations. It is executed under another label, just as
"re-engineering" is a euphemism for cut-backs in most cases. It just happens
that the I.T. community has consistently ranked in surveys as one of the least
admired corporate functions. I.T. therefore becomes an attractive target when
there is a quota how many bodies must leave. <p>
<p>
Cutting staff, divesting businesses and getting rid of hundreds of person-years
of accumulated know-how seems to be a prevailing compulsion among large firms
which are seeking to improve profitability by shrinking their size. <p>
<p>
One could say that outsourcing has many of the attributes of a widely
prevailing disorder known as "Anorexia nervosa." It is a psychological
disturbance involving the refusal to eat to the point of starvation. People
with anorexia have a distorted self-image which makes them feel "fat" even when
emaciated. Preoccupation with food and low self-esteem, along with emphatic
denial of the problem, characterize most anorexics. Similarly, executives in
companies with poor financial performance seem to concentrate on downsizing as
the preferred method for restoring competitiveness. <p>
<p>
I am in favor of outsourcing for any of the good reasons that would take
advantage of somebody else's capacity to accumulate know-how faster than if it
remains home-grown. It should not be applied as an emetic. I will be especially
encouraged about the prospects for outsourcing services when I get a large list
of prosperous and growing organizations that have picked this option as a way
of enhancing their mastery of information management.<p>
