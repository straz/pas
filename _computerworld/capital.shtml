<h2>Managing Capital Investment in Computers</h2>

It is fashionable nowadays to talk about the "information economy." According
to pundits the U.S. has already made the transition from an "industrial" to an
"information" age. No wonder, every manager of information technology aspires
to be in the vanguard of the new era. If information is indeed the wave of the
future, would it not be proper for the experts in managing information to take
over as the leaders of the yet unexplored pilgrimage by seizing control over
capital investment in computers?<p>
Whether IT professionals are destined to positions of leadership or just
remaining expert specialists is a matter of much conjecture. Those who see the
CIO as the innovative corporate strategist who guides the re-engineering and
the re-inventing of the corporation assert that information management is the
critical capital investment     for assuring the survival of any enterprise.
Those who observe that information technology expenditures account for only
about 1.5% of revenue of industrial firms would argue that computers are not
important and will become less so as their costs declines. Managing them will
not be much different than renting competitively priced telephone services.<p>
Any debate about the relative importance of any phenomenon is pointless unless
one can define how to measure it. In the industrial age the control of capital
was supreme. The acquisition, rationing and investment of capital was the crux
of all executive decisions. The accepted measure of corporate performance was
the efficiency of using capital. You bought equipment based on its
<i>Return-on-Investment</i>. You paid bonuses on the basis of
<i>Return-on-Assets.</i> The stock market valued your shares largely on trends
in your <i>Return-on-Equity</i>. As we evolve from this capital-centered point
of view, we must first understand whether there has been any change in the
significance of technology capital relative to information resources.<p>
For the last fifteen years I have collected data that separated the costs of
coordination -  information management costs - from the costs of delivery of
goods and services. On the basis of this data one can make a good approximation
of the total costs of information management of any firm. By adding the
expenses of Sales, General &amp; Administrative (S.G.&amp;A) and Research &amp;
Development (R&amp;D), as reported in published financial statements, it
possible to calculate what is its ratio of information management to capital
costs.<p>
The just completed 1993 information-to-capital ratios for 548 industrial firms
and 219 financial services firms offer new insights. For 86.3% of the
industrial firms the costs of information exceeded the costs of capital! That
number was 73.1% for the financial services firms that everybody assumes to be
capital-intensive.<p>
It just happens that the IT budgets for 164 of the industrial corporations are
known. IT accounted for slightly less than 10% of total expenses for
information management. The costs of IT capital (in the form of equipment
depreciation and rental payments) was only about 2% of the total cost of
managing information! <p>
These findings have implications on the practice of information management: <p>
* The last thing one should ever do is to evaluate the effectiveness of
information management on the basis of <i>Return-on-Capital</i>. The annual
cost of information technology assets is only about 1/50th of total information
costs. <p>
* Executives cannot ever hope to rely on managing the costs of information by
applying tight capital budgeting methods to investments in computers. The
overwhelming emphasis in government on controlling the acquisition of computers
as a handle on costs of information resource is not only irrelevant, but
bizarre in its procurement practices. <p>
* Computer managers should resist their compulsion to minimize the capital
costs of computing equipment as the key to effective information management.
Information expenses are too large for toleration of persistent  industrial-age
habits that rely on capital rationing. Time has come to examine information
technology as the essence of most businesses instead of just a machine tool.<p>
