<font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">e're at the end of corporate
computing as it has been practiced for the past 50 years.</font> From
now on, billions of computers will only be network peripherals.
Corporations will stop building and maintaining their unique hardware
and software capabilities as fixed costs.<p>

Most information-processing capabilities will be passed on to
computing utilities that will charge for services as a variable cost -
much like telephone service. IT budgets will gradually move from being
a vulnerable overhead expense and become a direct cost of operations,
like labor and materials.<p>

IT vendors have figured out that this new environment alters the
economics of how to reap extraordinary profits. Selling software or
shipping equipment doesn't offer any more of the profit growth that,
until last year, justified stratospheric market valuations. For
instance, until last year, the five-year average profit growth for
Microsoft, Oracle, Sun and IBM was 46.7%, 70.2%, 39.4% and 20.6%,
respectively.<p>

To prosper, new sources of revenue will be necessary as corporate
purchases for IT level off in the coming years.  Consequently,
Microsoft (with .Net and HailStorm), Sun (with Sun ONE),
Hewlett-Packard/Compaq (with e-Speak), Oracle (with Dynamic Services)
and IBM (with WebSphere) have all announced that they expect their
major future revenue growth to come from services.<p>

Dominant vendors will be in a position to make the case that shifting
from locally grown corporate solutions to industrial-strength
application services reduces the risks now inherent in corporate IT
management. The condition of corporate software assets has now reached
a state of sufficient chaos that corporate executives are ready to
welcome the takeover of IT by giant firms that will promise delivery
of application services at predictable prices. The evidence of the
vendors' intent can be found in their announcements.<p>

Their new services will displace the current practice of purchasing
packaged software that subsequently requires spending huge amounts of
money on integration, maintenance and upgrades. The vendors have
promoted the new services as a cost-avoidance opportunity and have
appealed to corporate management to purge their homegrown programs and
replace them with standard applications. The vendors are also
proposing to deliver the software as a guaranteed subscription
service, making a vendor's network an extension of every corporate
network. Once you're hooked up, the vendors will deliver online
enhancements for continuous technology refreshment. <p>

The vendors also plan to offer application-integration services that
promise the interoperability of applications within a corporation, as
well as among suppliers and customers - desirable objectives that few,
if any, large corporate IT departments can deliver now. <p>

What will most likely happen to vendors' software revenues? They'll
account for at least 40% of IT budgets over the next 10 years, up more
than threefold from the current 12%. In effect, the vendors'
traditional role of supplying information armaments will transform
into a role of being mercenaries participating in information-based
confrontations with those users' competitors.<p>

<h3>Implications</h3> 

This shift is proceeding at an unstoppable pace.  It will alter the
existing roles of corporate IT staffs, which will be asked to
concentrate on making computer expenditures profitable. <p>

This development will lead to a decline in the size of corporate IT
staffs and a substantial reduction in corporate capital devoted to IT.
To keep their jobs, a large part of the remaining IT staffers will
have to augment their skills in managing improvements in business
practices necessary to keep up with global information-based
competition.<p>

But vendors must address two issues before they can start displacing
the people who have been their most loyal customers: Can the vendors
deliver their goods with sufficient reliability? And can service
vendors offer sufficiently secure networking environments? The
question of security is the choking limitation on the pace at which
the transformation to services may proceed. If the vendors can't
guarantee protection against a wide range of risks, you may want to
wait before handing over the keys to a source you can't trust. <p>
