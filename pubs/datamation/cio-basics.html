<h2>CIOs Should Get Back to Basics</h2>

Executives often ask me why nobody prevented the current chaos and
proliferation of noninteroperable computing, data, and software. Why did
the ClOs avoid co-opting the threatening innovations and offer them to
their clients on more attractive terms? That is like asking why the
European lords did not co-opt the Mongolian hordes that invaded them for
five centuries. From a political standpoint, that was not feasible because
the agriculturally based feudal lords of Europe did not have much in common
with the invading nomadic tribes from the eastern steppe. There were no
institutions that could form the basis for reaching agreement on common
goals or shared principles of governance.<p>

When the microcomputer invasion occurred, neither the academics nor the
vendors offered a way of balancing the traditional integration and
asset-conservation roles of the CIO with the user's insistence on local
autonomy at just about any price. The suddenness of the microcomputer
onslaught does not offer a good excuse for this conceptual paralysis. The
proliferation of minicomputers in the 1970s offered enough warning to
anticipate massive attacks on the mainframe fortresses not later than by
the mid-1980s.<p>

Instead of dealing with this matter as a question of political
"governance," the conflicts involved posturing, image projections,
publicity, preferred-practice sermons, and popularized versions of academic
sociology. The solutions offered were closer to psychotherapy than to the
practice of pragmatic politics. Instead of negotiating and experimenting
with new institutional forms for coping with the problems of everyday
operations involving hundreds or thousands of computers, the academics and
vendors explored how to redefine the character of information management.<p>

They adopted the language of psychology that suggested that changing one's
personality is perhaps the most desirable way of adjusting to external
challenges. The problem with this approach was that there were as many
opinions about suitable personality adjustments as there were consultants
and academics.<p>

The early 1980s were the turning point for changing the characteristics of
information management from pragmatism to ideology. The change produced a
shift from an orientation toward operating results to a focus on preferred
practices for managing information systems. According to this view, you
ought to follow a prescribed set of processes enumerated by the experts. If
you can score well on someone's authoritative checklist, superior operating
results should appear. In the absence of verifiable results, all you have
to do is accumulate the right number of points for the right kinds of
attributes, according to weighting factors assigned by experts.<p>

Recently, I reviewed the results of a comprehensive effort to define
excellence in information management. It was a 156 page questionnaire
detailing over 200 desirable information management practices, with points
and relative weights of importance assigned to each factor. Most of the
points were awarded for following the "correct" process, such as having the
right documents, holding the right meetings, getting the right approval
signatures, following the prescribed system-development cycle. The
checklist paid no attention to making a thorough assessment of existing
problems, evaluating potential threats from competitors, or checking out
the economic fundamentals for affordability. The checklist neglected
assessing the quality of personnel to innovate, modernize, and experiment.<p>

This reminded me of the culture of the mandarins, the Chinese emperor's
administrators, who destroyed the once economically and culturally superior
Chinese civilization by forcing everyone to follow the correct process
without paying much attention to substance. I blame this intrusion of
mandarin-like thinking on the disorientation of the ClOs.<p>

The CIOs who are pragmatic politicians shed their vulnerable cost
structures, make it easy for managers to acquire microcomputers without
much headache, and offer innovative application solutions quickly and at
low cost. They take a practical view of who their constituency is - the
customers - and take care of them. They stay close to everyday operating
problems. Most important, they care about the motivation and the well-being
of the people who build and use their information systems.<p>

The CIOs who view themselves as the mandarins in charge of the correct
information management processes instead of performance choose to avoid
turmoil by lifting themselves above it. In their opinion, the proper role
of the CIO is to shift from the oversight of the organization's
technological infrastructure to following the shortest path that leads to
the seat of power. Instead of managing information, the mandarin CIO would
shape business strategy for the "information age."<p>

Somewhere along the way, the process-oriented CIOs lost sight of their
primary purpose, which is the delivery of reliable and low-cost information
services. Driven by ambition and prompted by preaching visionaries, they
have become infatuated with new roles in which they cannot succeed unless
they can simultaneously sustain technical excellence for what they are
already responsible for.<p>

This drifting away from the basics received encouragement from an
increasing propensity to appoint executives with hardly any information
services experience to become CIOs. Whatever the cause, this leads the CIOs
away from their primary mission. The process-oriented CIO will engage in
enthusiastic bidding for leadership roles to promote whatever new idea
becomes fashionable, such as total quality management, groupware,
electronic commerce, or multimedia.<p>

<h3>CIOs In Charge Of Reengineering</h3>

The current tendency of the process-oriented CIOs to take over the
leadership of reengineering programs makes them extremely vulnerable in
their relationship with their peers, on whose support they depend.
Reengineering focuses on eliminating unnecessary management positions and
reorganization of traditional functional roles. It has had a devastating
effect on management morale, especially when this is done in an unthinking
and insensitive manner to institute large-scale layoffs. The CIO who uses
his position to become a contract mercenary will be remembered as a
destructive and potentially alien agent. Reengineering, if driven primarily
by the CIO, will negate the capacity of the CIO to negotiate a governance
covenant on how to manage information.<p>

There is nothing wrong with a talented CIO gaining responsibility for an
innovative program that will make him a leader among his peers. There is
nothing wrong with a CIO becoming a COO or CEO. However. a review of actual
promotions does not bear out that this occurs in real life. COO and CEO
jobs almost always go to those individuals who have shown a steady record
of earning revenues from customers or who have earned the trust of the
Board of Directors as guardians of shareholder interests.
ClOs who have succumbed to the simplistic view that they should be
strategists instead of tending to their shop usually decrease their job
tenure expectancy to a half-life of less than 15 months. The only ones who
have gained from promoting ideas that extend the CIO's ambitions beyond
realistic limits are consultants, who have been earning $25,000 for
lectures and $500 per hour for "strategic consulting" in reorganizing the
CIO function after the next failure.<p>

The position of CIO is not and cannot be a proximate stepping stone into
the executive suite. The CIO will have to become an accepted operating
executive of a major business before his peers will ever give him the
political support that is essential for such advancement. The time has come
for the CIOs of this world to get back to basics and clean up their
noninteroperable, redundant, obsolete, overpriced, error-prone,
schedule-lagging, and credibility-lacking systems. Whoever can deliver the
best systems will survive to compete for a job as an operating manager who
earns revenue from paying customers instead of living off the allocations
of administrative overhead. The CIO who presides over a modern equivalent
of a "constitutional convention," during which a viable balance between
central coordination and local initiatives leads to harmony, will become
the godfather of information governance.<p>

<H3>Power Loss</h3>

<ul>
<li>A RECENT SURVEY of 236 large companies revealed that nearly half of the
top IT posts are held by individuals with primarily business and not
computer backgrounds.<p>

<LI>A RECENT SURVEY SHOWED that CIO turnover has increased for the sixth
straight year.<p>

<LI>OVER THE PAST YEAR top technology positions were filled with people with
business backgrounds twice as often as they were filled with people with
computer backgrounds.<p>

<LI>A MERE 5% OF THE 35O FIRMS polled by the Institute of Management
Accountants had their IS groups reporting to a CIO.
</ul>

What you are witnessing is a trend that points to consequences we can now
foresee. Corporations are in the process of giving up the management of
their computer technologies as a local cottage industry. The next round of
modernization investments will be under the management of commercial
companies that can show a lower risk in providing MIPS, kilopackets, and
gigabytes.<p>

Regardless of aspirations to a different status, information systems
managers are only brokers between the consumers of information products and
the information technologies delivered by vendors. As information
technologies become a commodity purchased from competing vendors, the
capacity to make purchasing decisions shifts to the consumers. Expensive
brokers will disappear under such conditions. They are disintermediated in
the same way as small local retail establishments become displaced by
supermarkets and superstores, leaving room only for specialized
establishments.<p>

Within the next 20 years, you'll see over half of the information
technology assets moving into the hands of commercially run service
utilities. "Outsourcing" is just a name that masks a profound change in the
way technology may support the majority of customers in the future. What
you see is the end of the craft guild mode and the beginning of the
industrialization of information processing. Corporations will be able to
take their IT budget out of overhead and make it a variable cost, just as
labor and materials are now a cost of production. For that they will not
need a CIO, but a chief technical officer that will assure enterprise-wide
systems integration, because every executive will be a chief information
officer. In this way, the CIOs will have succeeded beyond their dreams,
though not exactly in the form they originally visualized.<p>
