<P><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Maybe. But maybe not. In Paul Strassmann's new book

<P>The incantations that computers deliver competitive gains, speed up
business transactions, increase customer satisfaction, deliver superior
quality, and lead to improved profitability have become generally accepted
wisdom. How could U.S. corporations otherwise keep spending more money
on computers than on any other tooling investment? Nevertheless, computer
spending and performance are unrelated. </P>

<P>The first widely publicized challenge that computers may not be delivering
economic value was William Bowen's 1986 Fortune article &quot;The Puny
Payoff from Office Computers.&quot; Subsequently Gary Loveman reported
that investment in computers offered the least attractive returns as compared
with other investment options in his report in &quot;Information Technology
and the Corporation of the 1990's&quot; (MIT Press, 1994). After that,
the voice of the skeptics became louder. Steven Roach, a Morgan Stanley
economist, provided the econometric underpinning for those who were uncertain
about the validity of utopian advertisements by computer manufacturers.
Roach showed that information worker productivity had not increased in
more than 20 years while organizations were installing increased amounts
of computer capital equipment. </P>

<P>The reactions from the computer industry, academia, consultants, and
the technical press to the growing acceptance of Roach's thesis were ones
of puzzlement. Business publications filled the gap by generating a large
number of anecdotal cases that claimed, but did not substantiate, economic
gains. This may have been good journalism, but certainly not hard evidence.
To demonstrate that rising economic benefits were directly attributable
to increased computerization would necessitate the adoption of a generally
accepted method for relating the contributions of computers to profits.
No such method was available. There did not exist even an agreement on
how to approach such an assessment. </P>

<P>All of this confusion gave rise to the widely quoted &quot;computer
paradox&quot; phrase, originally attributed to the Nobel Prize economist
Robert Solow, who said, &quot;We see computers everywhere but not in the
productivity statistics.&quot; </P>

</TABLE>

<P>My 1990 book <I>The Business Value of Computers </I>(The Information
Economics Press) showed that there was no correlation whatsoever between
expenditures for information technologies and any known measure of profitability.
MIT's Eric Brynjolffson published &quot;The Productivity Paradox of Information
Technology&quot; (<I>Communications of the ACM, </I>1993), which confirmed
that there was no such relationship. Tom Landauer's 1995 book <I>The Trouble
with Computers </I>(The MIT Press) offered another cogent critique of the
questionable economic benefits from computerization. </P>

<P>The Gartner Group has now joined the rank of skeptics. B. Stewart's
paper &quot;Enterprise Performance Through IT: Linking Financial Management
to Contribution,&quot; delivered at the 1996 IT Expo in Lake Buena Vista,
Fla., announced that the net average return on information technology investments
for the period from 1985 through 1995 was only 1%. </P>

<P><B>Amount of spending</B> </P>

<P>The following figure is the total 1996 estimated world-wide spending
on information technologies: $1.076 trillion. </P>

<P>There are a number of ways of determining the United States' share of
global IT spending. According to a report in Fortune magazine (&quot;The
Growth of Computing Power,&quot; 1993), for the last few years the United
States operated about one-half of the world's installed computer capacity.
That suggests U.S. expenditures of roughly $500 billion. Another way of
estimating follows Roach's paper &quot;The Economics of Competitive Advantage&quot;
(<I>Morgan Stanley International Investment Research, </I>1996), which
states that the United States generates 22% of the world's total Gross
Domestic Product and that its ratio of information technology costs to
GDP is approximately double the rest of the world. That suggests a level
of spending of $473 billion. A third estimate uses the Morgan Stanley 2.8%
ratio of information technology purchases to the United States' GDP. That
number would be approximately $505 billion. Anyway you look at it, these
are large sums. </P>

<P><B>The international dimension</B> </P>

<P>According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census' 1995 Statistical Abstract
of the United States, the U.S., with 4.6% of the world's population and
21.3% of its Gross National Product, has installed about 50% of the global
computing power. </P>

</TABLE>

<P>The key technologies of the information age: microprocessors, operating
systems, computer languages, and office application software, all derive
their leadership from U.S. corporations. No other nation has seen fit to
make as heavy investments in computerization, by whatever measure one may
choose to make such comparisons. </P>

<P>The United States devotes a higher percentage of the GDP to information
technology spending than any other country. Only New Zealand (with 2.6%
of GDP), Sweden ( 2.4%) and Switzerland ( 2.4%) come close to spending
in the United States. It is also noteworthy that Japan, with its historically
high rates of productivity growth, spends only 1.4% of its GDP on IT. </P>

<P>High growth rates in information technology spending for other Asian
and Latin American countries reflect catching-up efforts, but in support
of relatively low levels of GDP. Though Japan together with Europe exceed
the U.S. GDP, it does not appear that they will surpass U.S. spending.
The high growth rate in U.S. spending is likely to continue. Therefore,
the concentration of global IT spending within the U.S. will remain close
to the present 50% share in the immediate future. </P>

<P>Singapore offers a puzzling case of exceptional economic growth while
keeping IT spending unusually low. According to the International Institute
for Management Development (IMD) and the World Economic Forum, in the last
six years Singapore has emerged as the country ranking consistently second
in global competitiveness. Despite widely publicized aspirations to become
the world's first information island, they allocate only half of a percent
of GDP to information technologies. (For more detailed information, see
IT 2000, A Vision of an Intelligent Island, National Information Infrastructure
Division, Singapore, 1993.) It is conceivable that Singapore's exceptionally
low levels of the government's share of the GDP may account for the sparseness
of computer-gobbling demands. </P>

<P>The April 11, 1994, issue of Forbes magazine quoted the American Electronics
Association's 1993 report on capital purchases, which highlights the relative
importance of information technologies. Electronics, defined as computers,
peripherals, office equipment, software, and telecommunication equipment,
amounted to 73% of a total of $646 billion global investments. The U.S.
accounted for 36% of that. What I find interesting is the importance of
information technologies as compared with all other electronic equipment.
Consumer sector purchases for electronics accounted for only 11% of the
total. This suggests that speculations about entertainment products becoming
the leaders of the next growth wave of electronic industry may be premature.
</P>

<P>One measure of the value of information technologies to the U.S. economy
concerns its relative standing as compared with international competition.
We need evidence that as compared with other economies, the U.S. has either
gained or lost its relative standing because of its extraordinary emphasis
on information technology investments. The answer to that question would
place the discussion about the productivity paradox not only in its domestic,
but also into its international, context. The fact is that the high rate
of U.S. expenditures for information technologies did not diminish the
U.S. standing as the country ranking first in global competitiveness. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, our principal competitors keep paying higher hourly wages.
According to Roach's &quot;The Economics of Competitive Advantage&quot;
(<I>Morgan Stanley International Investment Research, </I>1996), the hourly
compensation in manufacturing in the highly computerized U.S. is $17.20
per hour. The less computerized Europe pays $21.25, and the least computerized
Japan pays $23.66. What may appear as a computer paradox may in fact be
a social paradox. </P>

<P><B>Gathering of evidence</B> </P>

<P>While I was CIO at Xerox I was able to get reliable data about computer
budgets, business indicators, and financial results for more than 50 operating
divisions. These units competed with identical products, against identical
competitors, at worldwide locations. Yet the financial results delivered
by each operating unit varied enormously even though their computer budgets
as well as computer applications were comparable. My 1974 analysis showed
that there was absolutely no correlation between computer budgets and profits
for Xerox operating units. Information systems were important, but certainly
not a key to profitability as was claimed by computer vendors, automation
consultants, and academics in departments of computer science. </P>

<P>Subsequently I spent seven years gathering data from a collection of
other firms to see if they showed diversity similar to Xerox operating
units. By 1985 I was able to show a scatter diagram that displayed profit
performance for 84 companies, as related to their computer expenses. (For
further information, see &quot;Measuring Management Productivity,&quot;
<I>The Consultant</I>, Digital Equipment Corporation.) It showed no connection
between computer spending and financial results, regardless of the measures
of profitability or indicators of computer usage. </P>

<P>In <I>The Value of Computers</I>, I assembled data from 292 enterprises
while engaged in consulting work. These findings produced a diagram that
portrayed a random scatter pattern between computer budgets and returns
on investment. Most computer people and quite a few academicians did not
know what to make of such randomness. It did not conform to what was expected
by those who wished to see a strong positive correlation. </P>

<P>Some objected to these findings because the data originated as a by-product
of a consulting practice, and only troubled firms would seek diagnostic
help about their computer spending. This protest did not hold up under
scrutiny: The sample included a large number of businesses with little
computer spending and high profitability as well as many firms with enormous
computer spending and dismal financial results. </P>

<P><B>The infancy plea</B> </P>

<P>Others maintained that it would take decades before convincing evidence
about the benefits of computers would appear. There is a widely held belief
that all new technologies require an extended gestation period before they
can become profitable. The January 22, 1994, issue of the <I>Economist</I>
explained the apparent lack of returns on IT investments by pointing out
that it took from 1900 until 1920 for electrical motors to show substantive
returns. Accordingly, computerization was at this point of time still in
its introductory stage and therefore expectations of demonstrated profitability
were premature. The lack of correlation between computer spending and profitability
at present still reflects transient conditions that would disappear in
due course. </P>

<P>More than 40 years have passed. <I>Fortune </I>magazine dates the advent
of the computer age to the introduction of the UNIVAC computer in 1952.
Soon thereafter, sophisticated business applications became feasible. Forty-five
years of the computer age no longer qualifies it for an infancy exemption
from economic accountability. The frequently used argument about the as
yet latent economic potential of computerization has little merit. </P>

<P>A similar hypothesis, that computer profitability is still in the transition
phase to better results, also lacks evidence. The scatter diagram pattern
between corporate results and computer spending has retained the same shape
for over 20 years. In fact, the pattern of the results is trending away
from the positive. As the sample of companies keeps increasing, the correlation
is acquiring a slightly negative bias. Greater spending on computers relative
to employment levels is now associated with greater losses than before.
</P>

<P><B>Grosch's Law as a profit guide</B> </P>

<P>For a long time the reigning theory about the economics of computerization
was Grosch's Law. It asserted that there were huge economies of scale available
because of the rapidly declining costs of computers. Accordingly, the profitability
of computerization would show up when firms bought large-scale equipment
and centralized the workload in data centers for more efficient processing.
</P>

<P>Herbert Grosch, a one-time IBM employee and subsequently the head of
the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Bureau of Standards, said that
computing power increases with the square of its costs. Though Grosch never
published his work, his theories became the accepted truth for computer
capacity planning for more than 20 years, although it was never clear whether
Grosch's Law was a reflection of how IBM priced its computers or whether
it related to actual costs. It provided the rationale that a bigger computer
is always better. The IBM sales force used Grosch's rationale to persuade
organizations to acquire more computing capacity than they needed. Grosch's
Law also became the justification for offering time-sharing services from
big data centers as a substitute for distributed computing. </P>

<P>As yet, there is no evidence that computer investments are exhibiting
the economies of scale that conform to economists' favorite assumption
about the increasing returns realized from investments in capital goods.
The now thoroughly disproved Grosch's Law should serve as a reminder that
the history of the economics of computing has had an abundance of unsupported
misperceptions. Ideas of how to invest in new equipment acquire temporary
popularity until they are conveniently abandoned for yet another rationalization
of how to spend money. </P>

<P><B>Insufficient opportunities</B> </P>

<P>One explanation of the lagging computer payoffs proposes that information
technologies are just too difficult to use. Accordingly, learning and using
software costs U.S. firms five million hours a year, or $100 billion, thus
reducing the observed productivity gains. J. Krohe Jr.'s article &quot;The
Productivity Pit&quot; (<I>Across the Board</I>, 1993) notes that computer
users may take more time to complete their work as the tasks they perform
become less tedious and more enjoyable. </P>

<P><I>CIO</I> magazine reports that the Gartner Group priced the end-user
labor for operating a personal computer at close to $4,000 per employee
per annum, or approximately 10% of each employee's working hours. If one
considers that the average cost of ownership of networked client computers
to be at least $9,500, which amounts to about 20% of average payroll costs,
a firm must then demand at least that much in productivity gains. The estimated
cost of $9,500 per client may be low. When Microsoft outsourced the support
of their client/server network, as reported in S. Manes' &quot;A Bogus
but Useful Measure&quot; (<I>InformationWeek</I>), the contract numbers
revealed the magnitude of its expenses, which was $16,000 per client per
year. With service sector productivity gains recorded as less than 1% per
year, 20% productivity gains would be difficult to find. </P>

<P>Historic productivity increases over the last century averaged about
2.5% per annum. It may be unreasonable to expect computerization to achieve
much more than that in the future. The Gartner Group then surveyed people
who operated the networked clients. The operators claimed per person value-added
of $50,000 per year from computer services. This adds up to approximately
100% productivity gains. In the absence of independently verifiable financial
results, the claims made on the basis of such surveys are not believable.
</P>

<P>Capers Jones, Chairman of the Software Productivity Research Corporation,
estimates that the U.S. employs 1,750,000 software engineers, 437,500 software
personnel, and 273,438 software managers generating new applications for
a business population of about 60 million information workers. Using these
numbers, I come up with a $150 billion per annum cost estimate for software
plus an additional $70 billion for computer operations labor. The $100
billion per year estimate of costs for learning how to design applications
and how to use them is not far-fetched. It could account for increased
costs that are eating up many of the productivity gains realized elsewhere
in the organization. </P>

<P><B>The tale of the scatter diagram</B> </P>

<P>The diagram, &quot;What relationship?&quot; reflects financial results
and computer spending for 539 corporations. The financial results are for
1994, which by all standards was a prosperous year. Included are U.S.,
European, and Canadian firms. The points represent a random sample of diverse
businesses that include manufacturing, retailing, banking, and utility
firms. </P>

<P>The random pattern shown in the diagram does not contradict the fact
that frequently computers make decisive contributions to efficiency, competitive
viability, and value-creation. However, high or low spending levels for
computers associate with both inferior or superior results. High-performing
firms do not allocate more money to information systems than low-performing
firms. </P>

<P>This randomness did not change with other measures of profitability,
such as Return-on-Assets, Return-on-Net Investment, or Economic Value-Added
divided by Equity. Similarly, no measure of technology intensity, such
as IT spending per revenue or IT spending per assets made any difference.
I have even tried to correlate profitability with preferences for mainframe
computing or distributed computing. None of that was conclusive. </P>

<P>It is safe to say that so far nobody has produced any evidence to support
the popular myth that spending more on information technologies will boost
economic performance. The presumption that more IT spending is better remains
one of the most cherished beliefs of computerdom. It took experimental
science to dispel the dogmas of the ancients. It may take better research
and better metrics before executives will come to recognize that IT is
a subtle influence where an overdose of what works can also disable. </P>

<P><B>An examination of food firms</B> </P>

</TABLE>

<P>Differences in individual industrial segments could perhaps explain
why there is no relationship between information technologies spending
and return on equity. To test this conjecture, I segmented the entire database
of over 500 firms into 54 industrial groupings. The figure on p. 78 illustrates
the results for U.S. food firms. </P>

<P>The figure shows that Quaker Oats Company, with an exceptionally high
return-on-equity, is spending less than one-fourth of the per-capita IT
spending of H.J. Heinz and Archer Daniels. Yet CPC International, Sara
Lee, and Dean Foods show only one-third of the profitability, even though
their IT spending levels are comparable to that of Quaker Oats. Close competitors,
such as Pepsico and Coca-Cola, show enormous differences both in IT spending
as well as in profitability. Therefore, one cannot associate computerization
either with favorable or unfavorable corporate performance. </P>

<P>One of the most detailed recent studies of the relationship between
expenditures for computers and revenue-related determinants comes from
Akram Yosri's Ph.D. dissertation &quot;The relationship between information
technology expenditures and revenue contributing factors in large corporations&quot;
(Walden University, 1992). He collected 102 variables for each of 31 major
food firms covering the period from 1987 through 1990. He separated IT
costs into strategic, tactical, and operational. Yosri studied the allocation
of these costs to key activities such as support of order entry, sales
and marketing activities, and back office operations. As measures of performance
he tracked sales growth, market share, new market penetration, measures
of quality improvement, and productivity. Yosri collected data on training,
organizational stability, extent of centralization, and the state of technologies.
Clearly, this was a very ambitious study. </P>

<P>At the enterprise level of analysis, there were no significant correlations
between information technology spending and sales growth, market share
gain, effectiveness, quality, or productivity. Profits and economic value-added
are missing from these analyses, but it is unlikely that these would have
shown a relationship with IT anyway. At the functional level of analysis,
the only noteworthy effects were the contributions of information technology
spending in order-entry and back-office operations to sales growth and
productivity. These functions are unglamorous, but essential, applications
of computers. This thorough study suggests that the competency in managing
fundamentally important administrative processes remains the key to the
management of information technology investments. </P>

<P><B>Examining banking firms</B> </P>

<P>The great diversity in the food industry could conceal a fundamental
connection between computers and profitability. Factory operatives and
laborers account for as much as 30% of the workforce in food companies.
If computers relate to productivity, it would surely reveal itself in a
sector where information-handling is the sole occupation. Banking and insurance,
which buy over one-third of the corporate computer processing capacity,
would reveal such an association if there is one at all. The figure on
p. 80 shows the relationship between return on equity and IT expenditures
per capita for 30 banking firms. </P>

<P>The identical computer spending for Wells Fargo and BankAmerica, two
competing banks, does not result in identical profitability. Wells Fargo
performs twice as well as BankAmerica. NationsBank Services spends 15 times
more than Regions Financial Corporation, but shows almost identical profitability.
All that proves is that it is not computers, but how a firm manages them,
that makes the difference. The philosopher William James, one of the founders
of the school of pragmatism, has put that more simply: &quot;A difference
that makes no difference is no difference.&quot; </P>

<P>The lack of correlation of information technology spending with financial
results has led me to conclude that it is not computers that make the difference,
but what people do with them. Elevating computerization to the level of
a magic bullet of this civilization is a mistake that will find correction
in due course. It leads to the diminishing of what matters the most in
any enterprise: educated, committed, and imaginative individuals working
for organizations that place greater emphasis on people than on technologies.
</P>

<P><B>Value of computers</B> </P>

<P>Operations in most large corporations would rapidly come to a halt if
their computers ceased to function. The lifeline of all advanced post-industrial
societies now rests on the proper functioning of computers that control
the electric power, telecommunications, financial services, and energy-supply
enterprises. The increased vulnerability of our society to a deliberate
attack on the software that operates our information infrastructure is
now subject to a new military discipline, information warfare. </P>

<P>Computers are only tools. They are not an unqualified blessing. Identical
machines with identical software will perform admirably in one company
but will make things worse in an enterprise that has inferior management.
They enhance sound business practices. They also aggravate inefficiencies
whenever the people who use them are disorganized and unresponsive to customers'
needs. The best computer technologies will always add unnecessary costs
to a poorly managed firm. The problem seems to rest not with the inherent
capabilities of the technologies, which are awesome, but with the managerial
inability to use them effectively. For instance, Gartner Group researchers
allege that, &quot;Seventy percent of IT projects have not delivered their
expected benefits because they have failed to integrate the results into
work processes&quot;(&quot;The Second Age of IT: Increasing the Return
on Technology,&quot; <I>InSide Gartner Group</I>). How these researchers
have found what may be some of the most closely held corporate secrets
is a mystery. Nevertheless, this view appears often as an opinion of top
corporate executives. </P>

</TABLE>

<P>Business productivity has roots in well organized, well motivated, and
knowledgeable people who understand what to do with all of the information
that shows up on their computer screens. It would be too much to hope for
such excellence to prevail in all businesses. If computer expenditures
and corporate profits show no correlation, it is a reflection of the human
condition that excellence is an uneven occurrence. It is unrealistic to
expect that computerization could ever change that. </P>

<P><B>Not a simple relationship</B> </P>

<P>Business executives as well as computer experts must recognize that
the fortunes of an enterprise originate with the people who administer,
coordinate, and manage employees, suppliers, and customers. On average,
the cost of computerization equals less than one-fiftieth of revenues.
Therefore, it is absurd for a CEO, COO, or CFO to demand that the Chief
Information Executive prove how computer budgets relate directly to profits.
The best that computerization can deliver is to make information-handling
people more effective. </P>

<P>The relationship between corporate profitability and computer spending
has not changed in more than 20 years. It is unlikely that any direct relationship
between computerization and profitability will appear in the future. After
an exhaustive study, the Stanford Research Institute came to this identical
conclusion (see J.F. McAteer, Measuring the Return on Information Technology,
SRI International Business Intelligence Program, Report D95-1964, November-December
1995). Computers are only catalysts. Identically trained people in different
organizations can come to opposite conclusions from an examination of data
obtained by identical means. What matters is not what people see on their
computer screens, but what informed actions they take with what they learn.
</P>

<P>Unless robots end up running completely automated businesses, the relationship
between computerization and profitability will remain a random scatter
diagram for many years to come. // </P>
