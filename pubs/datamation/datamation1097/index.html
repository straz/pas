<P><I><B>Editor's Note:</B> In 1957, 40 years ago this month, the first
issue of Datamation rolled off the presses. In those four decades--nearly
two generations!--this magazine has chronicled the development of our unique,
complex, maddening, and fascinating industry.</I> </P>

<P><I>This month, we take a quick look back over the last 40 years. To
that end, we could think of no better observer than Paul A. Strassmann,
who has analyzed, written about, and participated in IT since 1953. We
have, therefore, arranged to reprint excerpts from Chapter 25, &quot;A
Historical Perspective,&quot; of his newest book, </I>The Squandered Computer
<I>(The Information Economics Press, 1997, New Canaan, Conn., <A HREF="http://www.strassmann.com">http://www.strassmann.com</A>).
To illustrate Mr. Strassmann's points, we have taken headlines, stories,
and quotes from past issues of Datamation.</I> </P>

<P><I>Mr. Strassmann begins his overview almost 70 years ago.</I> </P>

<H2>1930-1957: The machine accounting era</H2>

<P>Much of this earliest cycle originated in increased government tax regulations
that required the documentation of financial transactions. Centralization
of control over logistics, the result of World War II controls, also required
detailed accountability for physical goods. During this era, even senior
executives with a lifetime of experience in marketing punched-card equipment
were unable to understand the explosive demand for calculating devices.
</P>

<P>Tabulating installations made possible the direct displacement of clerical
labor, since government and corporate bureaucracies were unable to hire
sufficient staffs to perform boring, low-paid work with high reliability.
Actual savings were subject to after-the-fact audits. However, there was
a limit to how much of the routine low-grade clerical labor could be displaced
by machine accounting methods. Costs rose as organizations hired more administrators,
analysts, and accountants. <!---- sidebar ----></P>

<H2>1957-1963: The mechanization cycle</H2>

<P>The headquarters' staffs of increasingly bureaucratized global corporations
now expected to receive large amounts of detailed data from local operations.
They also required a computing capacity to process the punched cards and
paper forms that flooded into their mail rooms. The demand for data-processing
devices accelerated. Even the head of the world's largest tabulating equipment
manufacturer underestimated the demand for stored-program computers by
a wide margin. It was qualitative change in the relationships between centralized
and decentralized operations that motivated corporations to create datacenters
at corporate headquarters. </P>

<P>This investment cycle took place almost exclusively under the auspices
of financial executives who discovered that control over mechanization
of financial records expanded their power enormously. Cost reduction was
not the purpose of this cycle. It catered to the needs of the controllership
function that used computers to enlarge financial executives' influence
into every detail of production and marketing. Questions about the financial
justification of information technology investments did not arise, because
the financial executives were trusted to make the right decisions. Toward
the end of this cycle, large numbers of labor-intensive and inefficient
local computers started to feed data to the central machines. This offered
opportunities for new computing manufacturers, especially where national
origin made it politically expedient to set up firms in protected markets.
</P>

<P>The tabulating installations were then renamed, becoming the data-processing
departments. They fell under the supervision of a data-processing manager,
who usually belonged to the Data Processing Management Association. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,">In &quot;A Survey of Computer Facility Management,&quot;
p. 29, Charles M. Lawson, of System Development Corp. in Santa Monica,
Calif., reports on the results of a survey of 30 IT officers in Southern
California. He writes that centralization, as well as its opposite, is
a major issue: &quot;As for the issue of 'centralization vs. decentralization'
of computers within a company, two to one predicted a trend toward consolidation
of hardware. Several respondents predicted the growth of the satellite
concept, wherein small-scale computers communicated with a larger centralized
system.&quot;</FONT> </P>

<H2>1963-1969: The datacenter cycle</H2>

<P>In this stage, the demand for computers expanded faster than the manufacturing
capacity that produced them. Complex priority schemes assigned waiting-list
positions for equipment orders. Corporate information technology budgets
were rising at a rate of over 30% per annum. Consolidation of local marginal
datacenters and massive reprogramming of applications inherited from the
tabulating cycle now took place, the primary objective being the extension
of the influence and control of the financial executives over every routine
business transaction. Mainframe technology fit this approach perfectly,
and a symbiotic relationship between IBM and the financial executives was
formed. During this era, IBM maintained a price protection umbrella over
all equipment costs, which simplified the investment decisions. One negotiated
delivery schedules and technical support, not costs or budgets. </P>

<P>From the standpoint of corporate financial planning, the expenses for
information technologies did not require much justification, as long as
the data-processing function remained under the tutelage of the chief financial
officer. As reflected in national economic statistics, investments in computers
became noticeable, but not significant, for the first time. <!---- sidebar ----></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,">In his article, &quot;Computers in the World
of Real People,&quot; on p. 47, George Glaser, a principal of McKinsey
&amp; Co., writes about the lack of understanding of managerial and other
nontechnical corporate employees (real people) and the emerging IT professional:
&quot;[IT tells itself] plaintively that if management only understood
us, it would love us.... Starting from that fuzzy assumption, various remedies
are proposed and attempted. One popular approach is to urge managers to
go to 'computer school.' Having seen executives without previous experience
or interest in the computer get highly excited about their ability to write
FORTRAN programs after a two-day course, we know computer programming can
be a seductive task; so we resort to seduction. These courses are in fact
an effective way to stimulate interest--but interest alone is not enough.&quot;</FONT>

<H2>1969-1975: The time-sharing cycle</H2>

<P>The totalitarian-like reign of central mainframes and finance-department
dominance gave rise to intra-organizational conflict. The control of finance
over all computers suffered erosion as other departments, such as production,
engineering, and marketing, discovered that the possession of information
was synonymous with organizational power. The central information systems
organization responded by instituting a new round of equipment acquisitions
to preserve its hold on new technologies. They offered the nonfinancial
organizations access to centralized computing through time-sharing of mainframe
computers over slow telephone circuits. This was an attempt to preserve
an untenable position by extending the reach of information technology
through inappropriate technologies. </P>

<P>Some scientific, engineering, and, particularly, production departments
responded to these costly and nonresponsive services by taking their business
to independent information-service suppliers. The concept of outsourcing
information services took hold for the first time. </P>

<P>The defectors from the clutches of the centralized financial establishment
also started purchasing small-scale computers that offered on-line access
to computing power through high-speed terminals over local cabling. This
avoided dependency on expensive telephone circuits. The contest between
centralized and decentralized computing stimulated the expansion of relatively
sophisticated computing capacity at local levels. It also generated budget
growth where the expansion of computing capacity escaped attention from
corporate staffs. During this cycle, the need for integration between computing
and telecommunication became apparent. </P>

<P>Toward the end of this era, questions about computer investments appeared
on the agendas of executive committees. The usual reason was to settle
disputes between competing groups, each of which claimed it could save
money by gaining computing independence. Business executives came to recognize
that the lifecycle support costs of information processing was much larger
than the acquisition cost of computers as soon as each local site acquired
its own staff, consultants, and suppliers. </P>

<P>With rising budgets and increasing equipment acquisitions, a few corporations
started to promote their directors of data processing to vice presidents
of information systems. In isolated instances, the shape of the future
relationships became apparent when companies created captive information
services divisions to serve internal needs, as if the company's computer
users were customers. This was the beginning of the breakdown of one-time
monopolies into service-oriented units. </P>

writes on the new order of computing in &quot;Obsolescence in Business
Organization and Management,&quot; p. 29. He warns, &quot;...once information

<H2>1975-1981: The minicomputer cycle</H2>

<P>At this point, the purchasing power of computing and information services
started to migrate from being centralized, administered by the financial
executives, to the realm of consumers of computing, where it disappeared
into the cost of goods. This liberated enormous amounts of new discretionary
spending. Operating executives now found it attractive to trade off expenditures
for labor in favor of computerized automation. Local operations also acquired
their own systems development staffs or created relationships with consulting
firms. This crystallization of enclaves of local competence acted as a
catalyst for a chain reaction that then propelled the expanding demands
for computing. </P>

<P>The minicomputer investment cycle inaugurated the proliferation of computing
capacity. It initiated the shift from disciplined mainframe computing to
improvised computing whenever people could afford to purchase their own
equipment. Prices of computing dropped rapidly, as competition became more
intense and the costs of information processing shifted from the central
processing unit, where there was little competition, to computer peripherals
and to software, where new and hungry entrants made prices drop precipitously.
In this phase of development, it became increasingly difficult to account
for computer spending. Few directors of information systems could tell
how much their firms spent on information technologies. Computing started
to become embedded into a firm's goods-creation processes and therefore
disappeared into accounts, such as manufacturing machinery or research.
</P>

<P>Toward the end of this cycle it is possible to observe the phenomenon
that is to emerge in the future. Computer technologies would cease acting
as the means for exercising control over individuals and their work. The
image of the omnipresent &quot;big brother&quot; watching employees is
now mitigated by the discovery that the possession of computing power makes
local management feel more empowered. For the first time, computer technologies
became subservient to the capacity of local managers and professional employees
to satisfy their rising information-processing needs. </P>

<P>The emphasis on clever software ceased to be a priority concern. Increasingly
wasteful uses of cheap computing offered affordable processing for even
poorly designed applications. During this stage, the traditional formality
of systems-development methodologies lost importance as experimental and
interactive improvisations offered faster completion schedules. As a testimony
to the attractiveness of these approaches, a flood of new orders for computing
capacity was placed with computer vendors. It set the conditions for the
next investment cycle, as employees had acquired the taste for the instant
availability and personal ownership of the coveted computing resources.

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,">None other than Paul Strassmann, then at Xerox,
writes about the development of IT in &quot;Stages of Growth,&quot; p.
46. He notes: &quot;When one views the extent of office automation, the
rate of growth of the 'white collar' section in the economy, the increased
complexity of information handling demanded by our society, and the high
rate of inflation in labor rates while the cost of technology is dropping
radically, it is hard to accept the idea that we have reached maturity
in growth of office automation.&quot;</FONT> </P>

<H2>1981-1988: The microcomputer cycle</H2>

<P>The overwhelming acceptance of the microcomputer by office workers is
a phenomenon that hardly anyone foresaw. A business systems analyst, a
financial controller, or a senior executive in the 1970s would find it
inconceivable that, within 15 years, approximately three-quarters of U.S.
office workers would operate their own computers at their own desks. </P>

<P>The driving force behind the microcomputer investment cycle was the
anxiety of office workers that they may become obsolete. Another strong
motivation was the desire to get rid of the burdensome dependency on the
monopolistic computer department. The microcomputer investment cycle reflects
the shift from the dominance of computer experts to the defensive enthusiasm
of the office workers. It was the office workers who wished to add computer
skills to their resumes when large corporations began downsizing. In many
respects, it was the professional workers who led the charge to acquire
total computing independence. This was also the beginning of a transition
from people acquiring computer expertise to computer software acquiring
a better match with the capabilities of people. At this stage, the introduction
of microcomputers takes place without any pretense to attempt a financial
justification. It provides no possibility for even the most elementary
way for verifying the claimed benefits. </P>

<P>The explosive nature of the microcomputer investment cycle introduced
an element of discontinuity and surprise that is unprecedented in the history
of technology. The firms that dominated the earlier investment cycles,
such as Burroughs, Digital Equipment Corporation, Honeywell-Bull, IBM,
National Cash Register, and UNIVAC, toward the end of this stage showed
enormous financial losses and dismissed a large share of their work force.
</P>

<P>The corporation that embodied the attributes of computing independence
and local processing capacity better than others, Digital Equipment Corporation,
was unable to stretch its success from the minicomputer era into the microcomputer
cycle. It was a reflection of a bias that could not conceive of the acquisition
of a personal computer as more a matter of psychological effectiveness
than of engineering efficiency. Students will study the DEC case for years
as an example of engineering ideology overtaking socioeconomic comprehension,
and how those misjudgments led an exceptionally successful organization
to follow a path close to disastrous demise. </P>

<P>The personally operated computer offered an enormous expansion in accessibility
to calculating power. However, from the standpoint of improving cooperation
and coordination among office workers, the microcomputer inhibited communication.
Increasingly, it came to be recognized by management as a source of spreading
chaos. Nobody could determine the payoff from the microcomputer investments
made during this cycle since corporate overhead expenses rose faster than
revenues and profits. The generous spending on personal computers did not
produce convincing economic evidence, other than glowing anecdotes, that
organizations became more productive. </P>

<P>Those that gained from the increasing confusion were the computer professionals,
consultants, and sellers of prepackaged solutions. The revenues of the
consulting firms rose four times faster than sales of computer equipment.
The revenues of computer services firms grew twice as fast as those of
the consultants. The sales of shrink-wrapped software topped the growth
rates of everything else in the computer industry while realizing gross
margins exceeding those earned from luxury goods. </P>

<P>To cope with the proliferation of choice and the huge budget increases,
corporate management now elevated their principal computer executive to
the corporate rank with the title of chief information officer. <!---- sidebar ----></P>

<H2>1988-1995: The client/server investment cycle</H2>

<P>The client/server concept of organizing information services arrived
as a reaction against the unmanageable proliferation of stand-alone computers.
It did not happen, as was claimed, as the need to replace expensive mainframe
computing with a more distributed computing architecture. The evidence
is now overwhelming that mainframe computing is, in fact, more economical
than the highly acclaimed server substitute. </P>

<P>In terms of intracorporate politics, it was not prudent to promote this
investment cycle as a way of curbing microcomputer independence. Employees
enjoyed their newly gained computing independence too much to sanction
such an attack. However, something had to be done to restrain mushrooming
local initiatives. Excessive local autonomy inhibited attempts to interconnect
individual microcomputers and did not remedy the burdens of incompatible,
noninteroperable, insecure, and costly local area networks. </P>

<P>The generous funding for the client/server investment cycle, without
much economic justification, was a counterrevolutionary response to the
microcomputer uprisings against the central computer establishment. Unfortunately,
instead of delivering lower costs of computing through consolidation of
local networks under a network administrative discipline, the client/server
architecture turned out to be more expensive and less reliable. </P>

<P>For example, the vendors of client/server architectures, who have claimed,
for the last five years, to offer a low-cost alternative to mainframe computing,
will have to recant. In a recent survey, 53% of respondents to a survey
of 225 key IT managers reported that their client/server projects were
over budget, late, and had fewer features than specified. The survey also
found that 31% of all client/server projects suffered cancellation. Nobody
would ever fly an airline where 31% of flights crashed and where 53% of
the flights did not arrive at the scheduled destination. </P>

<P>A major contributor to the rising expenses for client/servers arose
from the propensity of supporters to specify the latest technologies for
all new applications. This had and still has the unfortunate result that
obsolescence sets in soon after the initial installation takes place. The
proponents of the best and latest equipment choices rarely, if ever, included
the costs of the upgrades in their project lifecycle projections. Yet the
costs of upgrades continue to rise steadily as the technological life of
equipment and software shrinks. For instance, a usually reliable source
of financial data estimates the cost of upgrading to a Windows95 environment
for a client/server configuration to be as much as $18,000 per server.
The average cost of upgrading a single local PC software from Windows 3.1
to Windows95 ranges from $360 to $960. The estimated cost to the U.S. economy
to proceed with the Windows95 upgrades would then be at least $20 billion.
</P>

<P>The personnel support costs for loosely organized distributed computing
far exceed any conceivable reductions in the costs of processing equipment.
However, favoring the client/server architecture is its capacity to improve
response times to inquiries. The increased independence of the microcomputer
operators from the disciplines of the central regime also allows the quick
development of local adaptations, modifications, and enhancements of standard
applications, now readily available at a low cost from off-the-shelf software
packages. However, the greatest gain from the client/server environment
is in its facility to permit a great deal of local experimentation that
leads to innovative computer solutions. With the increased attainment of
computer literacy, microcomputer customers now demand instant network feedback
and application flexibility. They now demand superior network performance,
rapid database access times, and instant response to the keystrokes that
they became accustomed to when they had stand-alone desktop machines at
their complete control. </P>

<P>To obtain these conveniences, someone must pay a higher price for technology,
support services, and training. For instance, the estimated first-year
client/server training costs for a mid-size network of 200 clients is $150,000,
for customer education $32,850, and for support staff training $87,000.
That adds up to $1,350 per client per year, or at least 50% more than the
first year depreciation of hardware and software. </P>

<H2>Today and tomorrow</H2>

<P><I>From here, Mr. Strassmann moves to the present, which he sees as
a transition period moving toward Web and intranet-based computing, and
looks to the future of computing. He provides us with a warning against
those who believe that computing technology will inevitably lead to better,
freer, and more humane societies:</I> </P>

<P>What may be politically acceptable under the guise of efficiency and
simplicity could easily be perverted into computer-perfected monitoring
of what people eat, where they are at any moment, what their habits are,
and with whom they communicate. Government-sanctioned elimination of all
cash in favor of electronically monitored transactions may be convenient
for the consumer and profitable for the credit-card companies. It may solve
many of the obstacles in law enforcement of cases involving tax evasion,
fraud, illegal payments, corruption, and information terrorism. However,
all of these advantages may be overshadowed by the specter of intrusions
on privacy and defenselessness from financial penalties from a hostile
government. I believe that finding a balance between efficiency and the
protection of constitutional rights will rise as one of the most burning
issues of the information age. // </P>
