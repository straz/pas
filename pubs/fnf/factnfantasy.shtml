<A NAME="Heading2">The Optimists' Views</A></h3>

<p>
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Wall Street bankers and assorted
chief business executives have explained the enormous gains in the 1990s stock
market by an upward expansion of the US economy which is expected to deliver
sustainable superior profits from steadily rising productivity gains.<a
name="fnB1" href="footnotes.shtml#fn1">[1]</a> These productivity enthusiasts argue that the
new electronic technologies have finally been harnessed by the workforce to
deliver improved operating results.<a name="fnB2" href="footnotes.shtml#fn2">[2]</a> To make
their case the optimists rely on a selected assortment of measures as well as
on prolific anecdotal evidence from business magazines. In a poll of 200 CEOs
and chief financial officers, the advances in information technology ranked
third as the enablers behind the economic growth in the 1990s.<a name="fnB3"
href="footnotes.shtml#fn3">[3]</a>
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading3">The Skeptics' Views</A></h3>

<p>
The productivity skeptics refer to official government statistics that
flatly deny that productivity has been rising.<a name="fnB4"
href="footnotes.shtml#fn4">[4]</a> According to government economists the annual rate of
productivity increases since 1990 has been slowing down as compared with the
prior three decades:<a name="fnB5" href="footnotes.shtml#fn5">[5]</a><p>

<b>Figure 1 - Productivity growth <br>
reported by US Bureau of Labor Statistics</b><p>
</center>

I do not trust the government's macroeconomic data about productivity
because they neglect accounting properly for the output of the service and
public sectors. One should not rely on this data to arrive at verifiable
conclusions. Furthermore, corporate management cannot make practical use of
this data. It is by the economists, for the economists and is of use only for
engaging in unresolvable disputes.
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading4">Relevance of Productivity</A></h3>

<p>
The stakes in these debates are enormous. The performance of the stock
market, the prospects of achieving a balanced budget and the ability to finance
Social Security plus Medicare all depend on the expectation of  steadily rising
productivity gains. The presumption that computers improve hard-to-measure
productivity offers a legitimacy to yet another proposal to invest money on
computers.<p>
I believe that the prevailing differences of opinion about productivity gains
cannot be resolved either with the existing government statistics and certainly
not with the selective taking apart of data by the productivity enthusiasts.
Only measures that can be explicitly related to corporate financial performance
can settle the arguments whether the US is either losing or gaining on
productivity growth in the private sector. Reliance on corporate financial data
has also the advantage of relocating the speculations from unverifiable
fantasies to provable productivity targets.
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading5">In Search of Evidence - Industrial Firms</A></h3>

<p>
U.S. industrial corporations include in their financial statements an
item known as Sales, General &amp; Administrative Cost (S.G.&amp;A). It
represents the costs of coordinating, controlling, guiding, promoting,
motivating, training and managing employees, customers and suppliers while
making and delivering the goods. This number is a reasonable approximation of
the costs of managing information, including the costs of computer hardware,
software, networks and staff. The S.G.&amp;A. largely accounts for  a firm's
overhead expenses. It also reflects the costs devoted to the generation and
consumption of all data.
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading6">Evaluating Productivity Gains</A></h4>

<p>
 If IT would have increased the productivity of those involved in
the handling of information, then it would now take less S.G.&amp;A. to manage
every dollar's worth of Cost of Goods Sold (C.O.G.) which are the expenses for
materials and labor.  A more information-productive firm would be able to
process more goods with less money spent on information-related activities.<p>
Take a case where a paper firm spends $100 million for materials and labor to
produce boxes. It also needs $40 million worth of sales and administrative
expense to manage production, distribution and selling. An advanced information
system is then introduced. The paper company still spends $100 million to make
boxes of the same quality, but now requires  only $30 million worth of sales
and administrative expenses to operate, including the cost of the new computer
system. Clearly, the productivity of information management shows an
improvement in this case. 
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading7">Productivity Gains of US Industrial Firms</A></h4>

<p>
Whether U.S. industrial firms, after a decade of intensive
computerization and after   spending about half a trillion dollars on
computers,  can now operate with less information management is something that
can be tested. That requires tracking how much C.O.G. is created for every
dollar spent on S.G.&amp;A.<p>
To give the IT optimists their best opportunity to look good, I examined the
financial records, over the past nine years, of the sixty-six largest and most
prestigious U.S. industrial corporations, with annual revenues of more than $10
billion <a name="fnB6" href="footnotes.shtml#fn6">[6]</a>:<p>

<center><b>Figure 2 - Largest US industrial corporations</b><p>
</center>Contrary to expectations, productivity hasn't improved during the last
decade. The amounts of S.G.&amp;A required to manage every dollar's worth of
labor and materials  hasn't come down despite massive IT  investments. There
has been a steady increase in  S.G.A from 1987 through 1993. Though I show
productivity gains since 1993, the cost  of  information management relatively
to the cost of goods is still higher  in 1996 than it was in 1987 and 1988.
Until the economic cycle of the 1990s runs its full course to reveal what
happens next, the productivity line must be drawn in the center of the trend.<a
name="fnB7" href="footnotes.shtml#fn7">[7]</a> <p>
This suggests that one dollars' worth of S.G.&amp;A., which could support $4.10
dollars worth of C.O.G., could manage only about $3.20 dollars worth of C.O.G.
after a decade of enormous spending on computers. The identical amounts of
information inputs managed lower outputs a decade later. Since productivity is
defined as the ratio of output divided by input, the following demonstrates a
productivity decline in the uses of information:  <p>
<p>

<center><IMG SRC="fig3.gif" width=394 height=223><p>
<b>Figure 3 - Productivity of information resources for largest US
industrial corporations</b><p>
</center>I am convinced that the 1993-1996 rise in productivity reflects the
"nuke them"  overhead headcount cuts  through "reengineering" upheavals.  There
is little  reason to believe that they are IT-enabled process improvements.
Magazine stories about methods used in staff    layoffs in some of the largest
employers of information workers, such as in  AT&amp;T, BellSouth, Chrysler,
Ford, General Motors, IBM,  McDonnel Douglas  and Xerox certainly do not
document IT productivity-induced gains. S.G.&amp;A.  was reduced by amputation.
In summary: the best and largest US industrial firms cannot show a lowering of
their costs of information management since 1988. Information costs have risen
relative to their cost of goods, not declined as is often claimed by the
computer advocates.

<p>
To place the US banks' computerization into the most favorable possible
light, I examined the financial records of the sixteen largest US banks with
revenues over five billion.<a name="fnB8" href="footnotes.shtml#fn8">[8]</a> These have
invested in computerization more heavily than any other segment of the economy,
as judged by the ratio of computer budgets to payroll costs. These banks are:<p>

<b>Figure 4 - Largest US banking corporations</b>
</center><p>

US banks show the costs of staff on their financial statements. These
costs are mostly for labor costs of the banks' information workforce. They
account for most of a bank's overhead cost.
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading9">Productivity of Banks Evaluated by Staff Expense Ratio </A></h4>

<p>
If information technology increased the productivity of the US
banks' personnel, then one would find a declining ratio of staff expense for
each dollar of revenue. Such an improvement would come from an effective
substitution of more productive computers for less productive administrative
labor.<p>
The results of our examination are as follows:<p>

<center><IMG SRC="fig5.gif" width=338 height=228><p>
<b>Figure 5 - Staff productivity for largest US banking corporations</b><p>
</center>Contrary to expectations of the productivity proponents, the revenue
per staff dollar has not increased. It has declined for a period of steady
productivity decline from 1989 through 1996. The recent reversals in this
productivity trends reflect mergers and consolidations, a strengthening of the
dollar currency, and the highest real interest income due to lower inflationary
expectations. That has little to do with computerization and much with
reorganization and a cyclically favorable state of the economy. The fact is
that in 1989 one dollars' worth of staff expense supported $7.50 dollars worth
of revenue, whereas seven years later - after a period of sustained
computerization - the same dollar supports only about $5.30 of revenue.<p>
Expecting reductions in staff costs from computerization is a reasonable
expectation for realizing favorable returns on investment. The banking industry
tends to spend enormous amounts of money on computers relative to its payroll
costs. The following table shows the relative importance of I.T. as compared
with staffing costs for two leading banking firms:<a name="fnB9"

<p>
<b>Figure 6 - I.T. Cost ratios for highly computerized banking firms</b><p>
</center>Though very few firms in my database spend close to a third of payroll
costs on I.T., this number often exceeds twenty percent for highly profitable
firms where employees receive high compensation. Therefore paying attention to
the effectiveness of I.T. expenditures has merit. In banking, insurance and
financial services the I.T. department is always the single largest cost center.
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading10">Productivity of Banks Evaluated by Non-Interest Expense Ratio </A></h4>

<p>
US banks show the costs of non-interest costs on their financial
statements. These costs include the costs of information technology, operating
expenses, outsourcing, facility costs in addition to labor costs of the banks'
information workforce. The non-interest expense reflects the bank's total
overhead costs.<p>
If information technology would reduce  US banks' overhead, then one would find
a declining ratio of non-interest expenses for each dollar of revenue. Such an
improvement would come from employing computers such as lowering the costs of
facilities through automatic tellers, substituting electronic fund transfer for
costs of postage and extending the geographic reach of banking services without
adding fixed costs.<p>
The results of our examination are as follows:<p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="fig7.gif" width=380 height=220><p>

<b>Figure 7 - I.T. Cost ratios for leading banking firms</b>
</center><p>

Contrary to expectations of the productivity proponents, the revenue
per dollar of non-interest expense has not increased. It has declined for a
period of steady productivity decline from 1989 through 1993. The recent
reversals in this productivity have little to do with computerization. The fact
is that in 1989 one dollars' worth of non-interest expense supported $3.65
dollars worth of revenue, whereas seven years later - after a period of
sustained computerization - the same dollar supports only $2.80 of revenue.<p>
The productivity decline, as measured by the staff productivity ratio, is
steeper than the drop reflected by the non-interest cost ratio. If one expects
to see a rise in banking productivity that would require either getting more
revenues or reducing overhead costs. Neither effects took place in banking. 
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading11">If Not Productivity, It Must be Profits</A></h4>

<p>
There are theoreticians who claim that in an information economy
firms must spend more money on coordination, management and planning, to
achieve increased profitability. The objective of computerization is then to
drive for increased profits and not for cutting the costs of staff, now
euphemistically called "knowledge workers."<p>
A way of testing this proposition is to examine the profitability of banking,
as measured by the Return-on-Shareholder Equity (ROE). Banking is relatively
homogeneous. It is more consistently computerized than any other sector of the
economy. Rising ROEs would offer a good argument favoring the theory that
computers are an investment that would enhance a bank's "strategic position"
and thereby its opportunity to earn higher profit margins. That presumption
does not hold up. Despite an exceptionally favorable economic climate that made
it possible for banks to earn the highest real interest incomes in recent
history, the shareholder returns do not show a rising trend: <p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="fig8.gif" width=385 height=255><p>
<b>Figure 8 - Shareholder returns for leading banking firms</b><p>
</center>

During most of the period of productivity decline, as measured by the
ratio of revenue to staff costs, the banking ROE shows high volatility. After
the productivity declines leveled off in 1994, there are no further gains in
profitability. If the heavy computerization investments were made to increase
profits, that would show up. It does not. Therefore, the theory linking
computerization to profitability and not to productivity is not valid.<p>

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading12">I.T. Spending and Salaries</A></h4>

<p>
To function at present levels of productivity the US information
workers in major corporations consume, on the average, $18,400 of information
technology for per person. The significance of this number can be misleading.
One of the most frequent errors in judging I.T. spending is to compare percent
of revenue or per capita spending ratios for firms in the same industry.<a
name="fnB10" href="footnotes.shtml#fn10">[10]</a> That has little merit if one considers that
there is a wide range in average compensation, per employee, for example in
banking:<p>

<p>
<center><b>Figure 9 - Average 1996 staff compensation for leading banking firms</b><p>
</center>I have found that I.T. spending is influenced by the compensation of
their employees. The higher the compensation, the greater the I.T. spending per
employee. This explains why spending per employee I.T. spending in banking can
vary from as little as $4,200 to well over $20,000. The more you pay an
employee the more I.T. expense they can justify as a potential gain in
productivity. <p>
Nevertheless, there is no correlation between I.T.  spending per employee and
banking profitability, or any other measure of productivity:<a name="fnB11"

In the absence of a relationship beetween profits - or any other
productivity indicator - one should doubt the direct link between computer
spending and increased output of banks. 
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading13">Labor-crunch Profitability</A></h4>

<p>
A number of financial analysts have explained the rapidly rising
profits of US corporations since 1995 by depressed wages and not by
productivity gains.<a name="fnB12" href="footnotes.shtml#fn12">[12]</a> Accordingly, average
hourly wages have declined since 1973. Even with multiple earners the average
household income has dropped appreciably since 1989. According to the
<i>Business Week</i> magazine this amounts to "a squeeze on workers." As
profits rose employee compensation declined.<a name="fnB13"
href="footnotes.shtml#fn13">[13]</a><p>
I distrust most of the numbers that originate from government statisticians.
Therefore, I decided to check up on wage levels, as reported in audited
financial statements. Unfortunately, only US banks report consistently how much
they spend on their staff. <p>
The following is a tabulation of average annual increases in staff costs per

<b>Figure 11 - Per person average banking pay  increases per year -

</center>The weighted average of per person pay increases is 8.57% per year.
With gains in compensation well above the rate of inflation the banking sector
did not put a "squeeze on workers" to counter falling productivity. More
spending for computers was added to rising payrolls. The automation proponents
must have justified some of their spending  by promising to offset rising
payroll costs. That did not happen, which explains why productivity did not
recover to former levels. 
<h3>
<A NAME="Heading14">Conclusions</A></h3>

<p>
Neither client/server, the Internet nor computer  networks have so far
materially  improved the productivity of information handling by the  premier
U.S. industrial corporations. In 1996 $1,109 billions in cost of goods required
the support from $301 billions in information management. In 1996 $207 billions
of revenue of US banks  consumed $75 billions in non-interest expense and $39
billions of staff costs.<p>
These ratios are now lower than they were in the period from 1987 through 1993.
I consider these declining ratios as proof that productivity of the information
handling workforce, which now accounts for 59% of US total employment, has
worsened in the last decade, not improved.     <p>
The time has come to face up to the facts: the stock-market analysts and the
over- optimistic  CEOs are misled. It's a myth that computers have measurably
increased overall US productivity of information. Whatever productivity gains
may have happened to increase profits took place in the factories and the
warehouses. Such realization will lead to placing IT expenses under much closer
financial scrutiny to make sure that  costs are not only contained, but that
the computerized work creates an  innovative stream of new profits.    <p>
Whatever productivity gains may have been achieved through computerization of
office work in the last decade have been squandered by the profligate waste of
human and technological resources. The bureaucratization and complexity of
business  processes have indeed increased, thereby creating the demand for more
information processing to get anything accomplished. However, increased amounts
of unnecessary work does not create wealth, whether done faster than before or
not. If prosperity is to continue, we need to  fulfill the promise of the
Information Age. We must deploy IT so the workforce can consistently deliver
more value with less effort.
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading15">Is There a Productivity Paradox?</A></h4>

<p>
The term "paradox" is used when reasoned acts deliver results
which are counter to expectations. I think that therein lies the fallacy, and
perhaps arrogance, of thinking about computers as a paradoxical phenomenon.
Computers are indeed a miraculous technology. Therefore, management has been
led to expect delivery of fantastic gains in productivity. The press, the
vendors and the consultants have reinforced such convictions.<p>
The facts are that:<p>

<ul>

<li>There is no correlation between computer spending and profitability;<p>
<li>There is no evidence that during the last decade the productivity of
information work in the US has improved. I have assembled in this chapter some
contrary evidence.<p>
</ul>
It is not helpful to keep talking about the persistence of a "productivity
paradox" as an unfulfilled dream. It is even less constructive to wish the
entire problem to disappear by arguing that the productivity gains exist, if we
only knew how to measure them.<p>
Time has come to face up to the evidence that often computer productivity is
not a mythical, intangible benefit but more often than not a productivity
detractor. That means placing I.T. expenses under a close financial scrutiny to
make sure that costs are not only contained, but that the computerized work
creates an innovative stream of new profits.  <p>
Whatever productivity gains in the application of information may have been
achieved through computerization in the last decade must have been squandered
by the rising bureaucratization of the US organizations and the profligate
waste of resources - human as well as technological. If prosperity is to
continue, as the optimists hope, we need to take advantage of what is the
promise of the information age. We must deploy information technologies to
create a sustained ability of the information workforce to manage the delivery
of more valuable results with less effort.
<h4>
<A NAME="Heading16">IT Remedies</A></h4>

<p>
Information costs have been rising relative to other production
costs, not declining. In accounting terms this means that hard-to-control and
largely fixed overhead costs have been displacing variable direct costs. The
impacts on planning, budgeting and controlling of information technologies are
far reaching. The pressure to reduce fixed overhead costs will mount,
especially during a downside swing of an economic cycle. The likely managerial
countermeasures will be: increase outsourcing of information services; license
software based on usage and shift computing to where capacity utilization can
take advantage of economies of scale. <p>

Within ten years the structure of the existing corporate information technology
budgets will see radical changes. The enormous fixed cost of computing assets
configured to meet local peak loads will be replaced by computing-on-demand
from commercial utilities.<a name="fnB14" href="footnotes.shtml#fn14">[14]</a>
Company-specific networks will be phased out in favor of carriers that will
auction off bandwidth based on real-time demands for capacity. Custom-made
applications requiring huge support staffs will be phased out in favor of
systems configured out of standard functional modules and billed in
microtransaction units. Computing will cease to be a firm-level cottage
industry aspiring to self-sufficiency. Computing services will become a
globally traded commodity.<p>

In the case of industrialization, the evolution from local guild-like
monopolies to globally traded markets took over three hundred years and is
right now in its final phase of historical development. In the case of the
information economy, the evolution from local guild-like monopolies has just
begun. However, the evolutionary pace will be much swifter because
telecommunications technology now makes it possible to bypass the local
institutional barrier to progress by offering instant cost reductions. With
little effort the customer can reap the benefits of obtaining a global marginal
price instead of having to pay for all of the local fixed costs. <p>

The acceleration in the acceptance of global trading in computerized services
also enjoys unique advantages which the marketing in industrial goods could
never realize. Network-based trades of information services can approach the
conditions of "perfect competition" as closely as a classical economist could
conceive. The variable transaction cost of any network services is extremely
low, which means that price can be set by real-time bidding. The buyers can
acquire perfect information about what they are purchasing, since the cost of
trying out a service is trivial. The costs for each transaction are also very
low because the metering and billing can be totally automated for less than a
few microcents per event. No intermediaries are needed to assure global market
access by buyers to sellers or vice versa, which eliminates most of the
overhead expenses for brokers, wholesalers, insurers, bankers, customs
officials and legions of purchasing agents who have always acted as a brake on
trade. If endowed with a sufficiently intelligent electronic device, any
consumer of services can connect directly to any supplier of services,
anywhere, anytime.<p>

When the new evolutionary changes in the conduct of information management will
materialize, we will be able to observe and measure the long heralded rise in
the productivity of the information resources. It will finally take less
information inputs to deliver more and better goods and services outputs.
