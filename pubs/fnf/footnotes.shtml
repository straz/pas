<a name="fn1" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB1">[1 (go back)]</a> Uchitelle, L. <u>Measuring productivity in
the 90s</u>, <i>The New York Times</i>, August 2, 1997. <i>The Economist</i>,
August 9, 1997 echoed this message in an editorial that much of the current
market exuberance is due to "...delightful notion that productivity ...is in
the throes of a secular rise, thanks to the spread of information
technology...". However, there is one banker, the chief economist of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, who states that "...there's not a shred of credible
evidence in the macro-economi that supports the notion of a meaningful
improvement in America's productivity." See Roach, S.S., <u>The Worker
Backlash</u>, <i>The New York Times</i>, August 24, 1997.<p>

<a name="fn2" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB2">[2 (go back)]</a> Uchitelle, L., <u>What Goes Up Must Usually,
Well, Stop Going Up</u>, <i>The New York Times</i>, August 10, 1997 quotes
David Wyss "People are looking for an easy explanation of why profits are doing
well." One explanation has been summoned:"...the main characteristic of this
new era is rising productivity. The new technologies, particularly computers
and telecommunications are making workers more productive." <p>

<a name="fn3" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB3">[3 (go back)]</a> Hoffman, T., <u>Feds link IT, productivity
but hard evidence is lacking</u>, <i>Computerworld</i>, August 25, 1997.<p>

<a name="fn4" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB4">[4 (go back)]</a> McNamee, M., <u>The Productivity Boom is
Still a Mystery</u>, <i>Business Week</i>, August 10, 1997. Melloan, G.,
<u>Where Is the Information Technology Payoff</u>, <i>The Wall Street
Journal</i>, August 11, 1997 echoes the identical view, adding that "...it
could be that the gains some businesses are making with computers are being
offset by higher costs elsewhere inflicted by government red tape." I have
documented support for the government's waste in Chapter 14 (Workload without
Payoff) in <i>The Squandered Computer</i>.<p>

<a name="fn5" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB5">[5 (go back)]</a> The Bureau of Labor Statistics, quoted in
<i>The New York Times</i>, August 2, 1997.<p>

<a name="fn6" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB6">[6 (go back)]</a> In 1996 this group had revenues of 1,898
billion dollars, or 43 percent of the total revenues of the 2,215 publicly
reported US industrials.<p>

<a name="fn7" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB7">[7 (go back)]</a> Using the "least squares" approximation
method.<p>

<a name="fn8" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB8">[8 (go back)]</a> In 1996 this group had revenues of 207
billion dollars, or 60 percent of the total revenues of the 189 publicly
reported US banking firms.<p>

<a name="fn9" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB9">[9 (go back)]</a>  I.T. budgets from <u>Leaders in
I.T.Excellence</u>, <i>CIO Magazine</i>, August 1997.<p>

<a name="fn10" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB10">[10 (go back)]</a> A number of consulting business have a
flourishing business in publishing such numbers. <p>

<a name="fn11" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB11">[11 (go back)]</a> The identical observation applies to
every other industrial sector I have studied so far, and I have looked at more
than fifty.<p>

<a name="fn12" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB12">[12 (go back)]</a> The most vocal proponent of this points
of view is Stephen S. Roach, chief econ<p>

<a name="fn13" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB13">[13 (go back)]</a> Bernstein, A., <u>Sharing Prosperity</u>,
<i>Business Week</i>, September 1, 1997. Most of the cited data come from the
Census Bureau, US Department of Commerce.<p>

<a name="fn14" href="factnfantasy.shtml#fnB14">[14 (go back)]</a> The statistical characteristics of
queuing theory will dictate that. Network connectivity restricted to a
geographical site heightens local workload peaks. I have seen corporate
networks with less than two percent  capacity utilization of the average
workload. This disparity makes it necessary for organizations to install large
multiples of average capacity thoughout the network to satisfy statistically
rare occurences. A sufficiently diversified computing utility can take care of
demands for high availability with only a fraction of assets in place.
