                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NASA's acting chief 
                    information officer plans a dramatic overhaul of the space 
                    agency's computer architecture that will create a single agencywide 
                    system that is highly secure, tightly controlled and far more 
                    responsive than the multiple systems the agency uses today.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sixteen days after 
                    assuming CIO duties, Paul Strassmann described a computer 
                    architecture managed by two highly secure &quot;mission control 
                    centers&quot; so well wired that they &quot;will know when 
                    anybody twitches on the network.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Strassmann's 
                    vision, NASA employees will need high-security smart cards 
                    to access their office buildings and their computers.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The space agency 
                    will create an &quot;information systems services utility&quot; 
                    that delivers &quot;end-to-end computing services all the 
                    way down, not only to the desktop, but also to the keystroke,&quot; 
                    Strassmann said during a meeting with reporters Aug. 2. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;NASA has 
                    bought [into] the fundamental premise that the network is 
                    the computer and the computers are just peripherals,&quot; 
                    Strassmann said. The concept represents &quot;a major reorientation 
                    of NASA to look at 21st century computing.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Strassmann said 
                    his plans would deliver &quot;substantial savings&quot; for 
                    NASA, which now spends more than $1.5 billion a year on its 
                    computer systems, although he did not specify the savings 
                    amount.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A key element of 
                    the planned information technology overhaul is modeled after 
                    NASA's &quot;major intellectual achievement&quot; &#8212; 
                    mission control, Strassmann said.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using as a prototype 
                    the mission control centers &#8212; which remotely manage 
                    the complex machinery of space flight &#8212; Strassmann said 
                    he wants to build two identical mission control centers to 
                    manage NASA's information systems. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each center will 
                    have the help desks, security control, communication availability 
                    and software and hardware configuration needed to run NASA's 
                    computer systems worldwide, he said.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mission control 
                    centers would operate around the clock and ideally would have 
                    no more than 20 minutes of downtime a year. They would be 
                    highly secure and hardened against terrorist and cyberterrorist 
                    attacks, he said. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea would 
                    &quot;take our experience from space and bring it to Earth,&quot; 
                    he said. &quot;We believe NASA can provide a very exciting 
                    new view of computing infrastructure for the 21st century 
                    for the federal government.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A small-scale version 
                    of one center will be operational Oct. 15 at the Marshall 
                    Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The model is a 
                    radical departure from the norm in the computer industry, 
                    where network control, security and support are typically 
                    separate functions, he said. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Security is another 
                    key element to the IT overhaul. To establish the &quot;electronic 
                    identity of people,&quot; Strassmann wants to issue smart 
                    cards to NASA employees, contractors and others associated 
                    with the agency. The cards would include a computer chip with 
                    information about the holder.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much more stringent 
                    security and access control at NASA are essential, he said. 
                    The agency is a constant target of hackers and possesses &quot;enormous 
                    intellectual property assets that [are] the envy of the world&quot; 
                    and must be protected. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mission control 
                    centers will know when users are on the NASA system and can 
                    disconnect them &quot;in a microsecond,&quot; Strassmann said.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the first 
                    steps in the IT overhaul will be replacing 10 separate accounting 
                    systems with one, he added. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He rejected tying 
                    together legacy systems and instead plans to convert existing 
                    financial records to a new format for a new, integrated financial 
                    management system. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A reliable accounting 
                    system is considered critical to bringing fiscal order to 
                    NASA, where a budget crunch is forcing curtailment of the 
                    space station program and threatening other space missions, 
                    such as sending exploratory craft to a moon of Jupiter and 
                    to Pluto. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IT is not a notable 
                    weakness at NASA, according to John Pike, head of Global Security.org, 
                    which monitors space and military programs. But at least one 
                    automated system &#8212; finance &#8212; needs reform.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They need 
                    a financial management system that can catch million-dollar 
                    cost overruns before they become billion- dollar cost overruns,&quot; 
                    he said. Space station cost overruns of $4 billion &quot;snuck 
                    up on them.&quot; </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The agency has 
                    &quot;squandered taxpayer dollars on finance systems that 
                    aren't compatible and can't talk to each other,&quot; said 
                    Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee who now edits the online 
                    publication NASA Watch.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But creating a 
                    centralized computer system may not improve NASA's efficiency, 
                    he said. &quot;They might spend more time watching people 
                    than doing the job they're supposed to be doing.&quot;</font><br>
