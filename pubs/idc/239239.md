title: 'Insider Theft of Intellectual Property'
---

This IDC study explores and analyzes the risks of insider theft of
intellectual property. Insider theft of intellectual property occurs
when an enterprise's authorized personnel pass intellectual assets to
unauthorized parties. This includes espionage, theft of confidential
scientific data, leaking of proprietary formulas, sharing of secure
customer information, disclosure of secret formulas, and transmission
of proprietary engineering designs.

Technical means should be used only for diagnostic purposes. They
cannot serve as exclusive countermeasures to prevent insider theft of
intellectual property. "The interception of illegal transmission of
intellectual property requires identification, tracing, and
intervention by counterintelligence personnel. The prevention of
intellectual property theft is costly because it involves the use of
methods that differ from the common practices that CIOs usually use,"
according to Paul Strassman, adjunct analyst, IDC Research Network.
