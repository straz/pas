title: 'Countering Software Robots'
---

### Abstract

This IDC study explores cyberattacks that occur when insiders grant
access to an outsider, allowing software robots (bots) to seize
control and command of the software in desktops, laptops, and mobile
devices. Bots have become the most potent threat to the security of
information systems. The security risks that they pose warrant the
attention by enterprise-level executives at the highest levels.

"Bots should be viewed in the context of cyberassaults on the
integrity of computer networks, and attacks by embedded robots require
immediate responses," says Paul Strassmann, adjunct research analyst,
CIO Agenda Team. "Initiating countermeasures requires reaching beyond
conventional prophylactic means such as antivirus software or
firewalls. Operating management must actively engage in countering
bot-based assaults because the conduct of their businesses is
jeopardized."
