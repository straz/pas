### Abstract

This IDC study focuses on the corruption of IT systems by trusted
insiders. "It includes characteristics of sabotage attacks, staffing
of defenses, conduct of insider sabotage, patterns of IT subversion,
reactions by angry employees, preventive measures, auditing an
incident created by an insider, human factors that cause sabotage, and
protection through recovery of operations," according to Paul
Strassman, adjunct research advisor, CIO Agenda Team.

This study alerts CIOs, senior managers, and boards of directors to
one of the most insidious perils emerging from datacenter
consolidations. IDC warns that the growth in applications, rising
employee turnover, and globalization into hybrid clouds make the
current era perilous. IT sabotage undermines internal and external
trust in executive management. Insider sabotage has an adverse effect
on a firm's reputation for integrity. Though there are other forms of
cybercrime such as the theft of secrets or embezzlement, a single act
of insider sabotage reflects adversely on top-level executives. For
this reason, information security has moved up as a top agenda in the
executive suite.
