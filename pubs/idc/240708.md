title: 'Top Management''s Responses to Cyberattacks'
---

### Abstract

This IDC study provides senior managers with a strategic approach to
cybersecurity. CEOs are becoming aware that major Internet disruptions
can occur at any time, and cyberattacks are seen as one of the
foremost hazards of the information age. With intellectual property,
trade secrets, and financial information at risk, CEOs are now paying
attention to matters that once were considered IT operational
issues. This document examines the CEO's role in IT strategy,
cybercorruption, the oversight of social communications, and
cybercrime-related contacts with government agencies.

"Cyberattacks have become a matter that requires the CEO's attention
because these attacks involve customers, shareholders, public
relations, and government relations," says IDC's adjunct research
analyst Paul Strassmann. "Furthermore, cybercrime appears on the CEO's
agenda in part because government agencies are placing it there."
