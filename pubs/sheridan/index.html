<h3>Conceptual Foundations</h3>
The case that Mr. Strassmann makes in this e-book is deceptively simple, yet very 
important.  From a business perspective, the cost of and use of knowledge must be 
accounted for just like any other resource or investment.  If you "put on your business 
hat" this seems both obvious and feasible - but those who have tried to actually do it, 
have not usually produce credible results.  I put such previous failures down to two 
shortcomings:  (1) there is often a high "magical" component to many conceptions of 
knowledge; and (2) attempted costing formulae are not well developed.
<P>
In this publication, Paul Strassmann overcomes both challenges.  Regarding the definition 
of knowledge itself, he shows that what is needed is NOT an essentialist approach (trying 
to explain everything), BUT RATHER a pragmatic approach (what value does it provide).  
This is analogous to defining energy by the results it produces, NOT the "real meaning" 
of the phenomena.  Since by this business definition, value is the measure of importance, 
value-added is the concept Strassmann harnesses to evaluate productivity AND appraise 
investment.
<P>
To illustrate the concept, Strassmann uses a "case study" throughout the book.  He gives 
the rationale, formulae, outcomes, and supporting data for the steps in his methodology.  
After reading the book, it suddenly makes sense that there are criteria by which to judge 
the feasibility and results of investment in computer systems and employee training.  And 
although these are business criteria, they require some new thinking about how to 
attribute characteristics and calculate costs.  Since knowledge is a different kind of 
resource, it requires metrics that represent the unique contribution it makes to business, 
especially since that contribution provides a growing proportion of the value-added AND 
completely reorganizes the value-chain in the process.  This is a "crash course" in the 
economics of information and knowledge, and in less than 100 pages you can experience a 
paradigm shift that transforms knowledge from a magical elixir to a business tool.

<h3>Methodological Elaboration</h3>
Clare & Detore use the kind of insights Strassmann provides to develop an elaborate 
methodology for applying such costing to knowledge investment decisions.  First they 
introduce you to the many accounting formulae that are used to price other investments.  
Then they show that there are analogous features in knowledge parameters, so each 
formula can be transformed into a tool for measuring knowledge value.  Similar to the 
concept of a value-chain is that of a knowledge tree, which allows you to chart how inputs 
are organized and synthesized into knowledge-value outputs.  The over-all result is a 
template for knowledge management proposals, and a set of tools to estimate the 
advisability of different types of investment in knowledge assets (skills, processes, 
technologies).  
<P>
The book includes a CD with spreadsheets that have the formulae built in to them - you 
add the figures from the case you want to compute, and the results are provided.  There 
are sensitivity analysis calculators to help you determine what is important in the 
process, and electronic document versions of the proposal template.  For those knowledge 
management investment decisions with substantial sums at stake, Clare and Detore provide 
the tools to clarify the issues and justify the choices that a business proposal should 
include.  And in the case of questionable proposals, there are also the indicators of 
where and how to make adjustments to assure viability.  
Now we can apply knowledge to knowledge management instead of just "winging it"!
