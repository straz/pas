<p>Any aggregation of computers, software and networks can be viewed as a
"cloud." The U.S. Defense Department is actually a cloud consisting of
thousands of networks, tens of thousands of servers and millions of
access points. The department's fiscal year 2012 spending for
information technologies is $38.4 billion. This includes the costs of
civilian and military payroll as well as most information technology
spending on intelligence. The total Defense Department cloud could be
more than $50 billion, which is 10 times larger than the budget of the
10 largest commercial firms. So, the question is: How efficient is the
Defense Department in making good use of its information
technology?</P>

<P>The efficiency of any system is defined as the
ratio of outputs to inputs - also known as the productivity ratio of
an enterprise. If only a small fraction of inputs is converted to
outputs, then information technology can be labeled as
inefficient. The metric of the productivity ratio always is evaluated
in dollars. These types of numbers are readily available for the
Defense Department because the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
publishes analyses of information costs every year.</P>

<P>Making these output/input evaluations requires
finding out how much of the total available information technology
budget is consumed in management, which is defined as, "... costs
incurred in the general upkeep or running of a plant, premises, or
business, and not attributable to specific products or
results." </P>

<P>The OMB lists the "information and technology
management" function for information technology. This includes all
planning, administrative, management and acquisition costs as well as
communications costs that cannot be attributed to any specific
output. </P>

<P>This table shows that only 48.8 percent of Defense
Department functions are related to the costs of output. The remaining
51.2 percent are attributed to "management," which includes
expenditures for Defense Department chief information officers and
component staffs. The information technology output/input ratio for
the entire Defense Department can be estimated to be less than
half.</P>

Is the 48.8 percent ratio a good measure of information technology performance? Can it be compared with the best commercial practices? </P>

<P>I have worked with productivity numbers for more
than 30 years, and I have published more than 100 articles and books
on this topic and own a registered trademark on Information
Productivity. In terms of information technology spending per capita,
the Defense Department is most comparable to the financial services
sector because of its large amount of purchase transactions and huge
assets. By comparison, major banks - where the information technology
budget for the top firms averages $2 billion - information technology
productivity always has shown a ratio between 70 percent and 80
percent, in contrast with less than 50 percent for the Defense
Department. </P>

<P>The primary reason for the difference between
commercial firms and the Defense Department are expenditures for
information technology infrastructure maintenance ($7.7 billion) and
for information security ($2.8 billion). These two items account for
more than half of the communications expense that is included in the
Defense Department management costs. </P>

<P>With an estimate of 15,000 defense networks in
operation, the first priority for any future cost reductions should be
the consolidation of communications. According to a 2006 Government
Accountability Office report, the Global Information Grid (GIG) was
supposed to achieve major reductions in the number of networks. That
has not happened.</P>

<P>The Defense Department must restructure its
information technology communication operations away from an
environment where it is vulnerable to multiple cyber attacks. Cutting
down on the number of networks requires shifting of computing to a
much smaller number of enterprise clouds. This will reduce costs as
well as increase security. </P>
