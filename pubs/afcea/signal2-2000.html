<span class="initial">P</span>aul A. Strassmann, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense 
for command, control, communications and intelligence, has 
developed a conflict hypothesis to explain the complexity and 
enormous increase in the power of computers. His model of 
business computer use is that of a commercial version of 
information warfare. The large spending on computerization and the 
penetration and pervasiveness of computers is not an economic 
phenomenon; it is a warfare phenomenon where competition leads to 
the equivalent of an information-based conflict, he posits.<p>

"What you have in business today is a giant arms race, where 
everybody is leapfrogging everybody else every two years or so," 
Strassmann says. "You can use computers as a weapon of choice to 
attack an established organization." This attack is performed within 
the guidelines of market competition, not as traditional industrial 
sabotage. The commercial information onslaught is used to either 
defend or overtake a competitive position.<p>

For example, a retailer might "deny oxygen" to an established 
competitor by offering advanced World Wide Web sales that 
undercut the other store in terms of price, inventory availability or 
convenience. "E-commerce is a giant confrontation of competitive 
interests," Strassmann emphasizes.<p>

"The appropriate model is not a productivity model. We are in a 
transition period where the model is one of commercial use of 
computers for commercial warfare."<p>

This hypothesis also explains why many e-commerce giants are not 
yet turning a profit, and may not in the foreseeable future, he says. 
Historically, imperial forces trying to acquire land experienced 
considerable manpower losses in warfare. Even the land objective 
and its assets can be destroyed during the transition period of 
conquest, Strassmann notes. Money-losing e-commerce companies 
are not wasting time and resources but instead are positioning 
themselves to reap the benefits when they win the competition. 
"Warfare is a suitable topic for explaining the current transition 
period," he says. "In fact, it is a more apt model for understanding 
what's going on than some arcane economic theories that have not 
been supported with data."<p>

Companies must enter this commercial information warfare realm 
not only to be successful, but merely to survive, "Survival comes 
first," Strassmann says. "Then, if you have survived, you have an 
option to perhaps be successful. Right now much of the computer 
armament race is driven by fear.<p>

"The United States has basically divested itself of manufacturing 
capability and saddled itself with an enormous corporate overhead," 
Strassmann warns. "Consequently, it has no choice but to look to 
computerization and information technologies, as long as it has 
dominance in that area, as a weapon of choice to obtain its share of 
world trade and improvement in economic position."<p>
