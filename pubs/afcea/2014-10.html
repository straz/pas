<h3>Less is not more when budget cuts constrain effective cyberdefense.</h3>

<p>Budget cuts and rapidly improving information technology are
forcing the U.S. Defense Department to confront increasing
cybersecurity demands without commensurate increases in available
resources. Cybersecurity costs are increasing with both the complexity
of new technologies and the worsening threat picture. However,
solutions to this challenge do exist &mdash; if the Defense Department opts
for new approaches.</p>

<p>One way of characterizing the current Defense Department situation
is to view it as an inability to meet rising demands for systems
without having adequate funding for cyberdefenses. Meanwhile, the
costs of cybersecurity are rising. The progress in meeting increased
cyberthreats is lagging, which is not acceptable.</p>

<p>The department needs to anticipate that the defenses against
cyberattack incursions will be growing both in scope and in
complexity. At present, the costs of cyberdefense are reaching levels
that are not affordable. Therefore, the immediate step in managing the
information technology budget for 2015 and beyond is to start reducing
the costs of cyberoperations. This calls for the formation of a
unified joint cyberdefenses overlay that is based on virtualization of
security services and a centralization of defenses.</p>

<p>According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the $35.4
billion Defense Department 2015 information technology budget
represents a decline of 6 percent. Such cost reductions will offset
the budget gains made by all other agencies. The Defense Department
now is in a position to fund all other federal government information
technology spending increases. Clearly, the reductions in 2015 defense
information technology expenses will require the application of
unprecedented solutions.</p>

<p>Cyberdefenses largely are the reason that has occurred. Defense
Department information security spending for fiscal year 2013 is now
$7.1 billion, or 19.4 percent of the total defense information
technology budget. That share of total costs represents the single
largest share of available money to be used for protection. Spending
for security is likely to rise again in fiscal 2015. So far,
cyberdefenses are incomplete. To reach the mandatory 100 percent
compliance will be costly because the capture of all of the remaining
inadequacies is increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>Cyberdefense comprises three categories: Prevent malicious cyber
activities ($2.5 billion); detect, analyze and mitigate intrusions ($1
billion); and organize the cybersecurity environment ($3.6
billion). And, most likely, these costs are understated. Cybersecurity
related to the organization, as well as training expenses, are
incurred in the military services and with contractors, where these
costs are not accounted for directly.</p>

<p>A list of indicators (see box, this page) suggests that large
amounts of work must be done to reach an acceptable security
condition. Attackers may leverage the slightest omission in defenses
to penetrate their chosen targets.</p>

<p>A fifth of the Defense Department&rsquo;s total information technology
spending now is committed to security, which is by far the largest
share of expenditures in the records. The department also must expend
more than 60 percent of its information technology budget on
maintaining ongoing operations. Consequently, less than 10 percent of
the money is available to bring in innovative information technologies
that would satisfy the rapidly evolving new demands for an armed force
that is undergoing a major transformation on how to carry out its
missions. The Defense Department information technology budget is
underfunded unless new approaches can be found to alter how
increasingly scarce funds are spent.</p>

<p>Security spending is mandatory and cannot be changed, because in
the age of information, warfare insecurity can be
fatal. Unfortunately, improved security does not deliver economic
benefits. It should be seen as nonproductive overhead and not as a
contribution to business value.</p>

<p>At present, the Defense Department finds itself unable to deploy
its information technology to meet the needs required for supporting
information operations. The department seems to be stuck in advancing
its information technology capabilities at the critical time when
second-generation systems are starting to be replaced by
third-generation solutions, which offer enormous expansions of
processing capacity at a much lower cost. The department must
determine how to advance from the current dearth of funds to making
many innovative investments.</p>

<p>An immediate reduction in security spending will be necessary to
help the Defense Department escape from its current insufficiency of
innovation funds. Plunging into modernization of the existing
inventory of diverse applications is not feasible. Legacy systems
consist of thousands of applications, each with their own programming
codes that are operated with incompatible databases, each with their
own noninteroperable architectures. Retrofitting security capabilities
for every situation cannot be accomplished because the wide diversity
of contract vehicles would make such acquisitions difficult to
execute.</p>

<p>Replacing legacy systems to improve performance is too costly. It
would take years to do that if the Defense Department lives with the
current limitations in development funds. The need for protection is
now.</p>

<p>The only workable solution is to leave existing applications in
as-is conditions except for overlaying information security into a
shared security platform on top. Security should not be an attachment
to individual systems but instead a part of a shared infrastructure
platform. Such an approach will eliminate fragmented procurement and
development practices. It will assure consistent deployment of
cybersecurity technologies.</p>

<p>This type of shift will require strong leadership from the Office
of the Secretary of Defense. Defense Department components would have
look to support from a shared security infrastructure for all new
projects rather than procure new security solutions for each
project. Meanwhile, application enhancements and maintenance for
legacy systems can remain as a component asset. Only the security
infrastructure layer would assume the characteristics of a joint
environment.</p>

<p>Cyberattacks do not discriminate between Army, Navy or Air Force
targets. In the era of cyberwarfare, targeted attacks will enter an
Army system and then penetrate a Navy application. Therefore,
components must share the ownership of common security countermeasures
instead of creating multiple points of vulnerability at security
interfaces currently located for each separate server.</p>

<p>This type of architecture will require setting up a central support
organization to proceed with the adoption of joint security
services. Particular attention should be given to the strengthening of
governance, so that implementation could proceed without further
delay.</p>

<p>The technical solution for finding a consistent approach to
offering a broad spectrum of security features is to impose an add-on
hypervisor overlay on all hardware facilities. Software-defined
communication servers then can operate as virtual machines. Such
virtualization would allow a collection of servers to operate as if it
were a single virtual operating platform. In this way, multiple
instances of operating systems for separate applications can share the
virtualized hardware resources under identical security controls.</p>

<p>The creation of shared cybersecurity services in turn will require
the creation of several network control centers (NCCs) where scarce
personnel, including counterintelligence staffs, would be placed. NCCs
should be housed in high-security buildings, and each should be set up
as a fail-over site for every other NCC. How the NCCs should be
managed becomes a policy matter. The NCC facilities also would become
the hubs for managing the communications infrastructure for the entire
Defense Department.</p>

<p>Placing cybersecurity countermeasures into an all-encompassing
infrastructure will require operations to be controlled by a
comprehensive suite of security software to update security features
from multiple control consoles in real time. These central controls
should be performed rapidly to reduce the gap between the initial
detection of potential security breaches and the capability of the NCC
responders to invalidate unprecedented attacks.</p>

<p>Transforming individually managed security capabilities to joint
operations then can be accomplished through the virtualization of all
servers. When the newly added network security layer is overlaid, the
Army, Navy and Air Force no longer will face the laborious efforts
involved in providing security features for each separate
application. Instead, server security will be managed centrally as an
enterprisewide joint service. This arrangement would simplify the
modification of new security capabilities in seconds and minutes
rather than in hours or weeks.</p>

<p>The virtualized joint security service would leave the individual
services with full control over applications without interfering with
their existing features or functions. Legacy applications would remain
in place, and only the top virtualized layer would take over the
security protection missions. All of its savings would be realized in
the form of a steep reduction in cybersecurity costs to a target of
less than 10 percent of the total information technology
budget. Commercial firms, particularly well-protected financial
services enterprises, already have managed to concentrate security
services across all applications into top-level layers where the
countering of all cybersecurity penetrations is mostly
encountered. The Defense Department can learn from them.</p>
