<P>Among many definitions, the Oxford dictionary defines a silo as a
process that operates in isolation. In the U.S. Defense Department,
everyone works in separate components. Computer silos have
proliferated with the availability of a huge number of customized
information technology solutions. </P>

<P>The problem with silos is that people in them are unable to work
with others on related problems. An expeditionary force is in a silo
if it cannot exchange information with other units. The inability of
achieve interoperability will impair coordination. Interoperability
with units in the same battlespace is critical for any military
action. As the Defense Department is evolving into asymmetric warfare,
the capacity to break down silos never has been more urgent.</P>

<P>Information technology has the means to break down inter-silo
communications. A key is to define silo interoperability in terms of
the budget that has been carved out for every unique information
technology project.</P>

<P>How do we define a silo? How many silos are in the Defense
Department? These questions have bothered me since the end of the Cold
War. </P>

<P>At some meetings I attended, general officers used the term "silo"
as an explanation for why battlefield interoperability did not
work. Silos were found everywhere. Often, one colonel's silo was
another commander's way of maintaining control over
communications.</P>

<P>An enumeration of the Defense Department's silos showed up in this
year's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) information technology
dashboard (www.itdashboard.gov/data_feeds). It identified 2,904
separately funded information technology projects for fiscal year
2012.</P>

<P>Each OMB project had a unique funding source and funding code,
specified by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
comptroller. Each project was tagged by its funding source name and
showed total information technology spending budgets for three
years. In addition, the OMB identified each project by its funding
sources number and by a separate OMB form 53A classification. These
tabulations pinned down the dollar definition for each Defense
Department silo unambiguously. </P>

<P>That added up to 61 projects, each with budgets over $100 million,
with total spending of $16 billion in fiscal year 2012. In addition,
464 projects each had budgets between $10 million and $100 million for
a total cost of $14 billion. And 2,379 projects, costing less than $10
million each, were worth a total of $4 billion. </P>

<P>Defense Department program management must keep track of thousands
of small projects to ensure they would be interoperable with larger
projects and vice versa. The complexity of maintaining synchronization
between large projects and small projects imposed an extremely costly
burden on overall information technology spending. </P>

<P>If the Defense Department would operate in a totally interoperable
software-as-a-service (SaaS) environment that meets the criteria
spelled out in various OSD strategic presentations, then theoretically
the department could function within only one silo. Individual
projects would differ from each other only by different applications
and their associated data. However, the one-silo Defense Department
will not happen because of too many legacy enclaves. In addition, the
silos already in place have multiyear budgets, which makes them
ingrown and not easily changed.</P>

<P>The best that the department can do is to collapse silos. It would
depend on a handful of shared pools of networking, storage, servers,
operating systems, middleware and control commands. The department
then could migrate from 2,904 silos to running only a few
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and
SaaS clouds. Costs would be materially less, whereas security would
increase manifold.</P>

<P>However, the Defense Department currently is not set up to proceed
with the shrinking of silos. Depending on how each project sets up its
infrastructure, the department must continue at this time to operate
thousands of silos because that is the way funds are parceled out to
program managers. Large projects are burdened with excessive
maintenance costs. Small projects keep changing what they need. The
results are elongated schedules and excessive costs. Therefore,
defense systems are neither interoperable nor effective in meeting
emerging military requirements. </P>

<P>The Defense Department must get rid of hundreds of incompatible
silos. It is the variety in silo-designed infrastructures that is
sinking the department into a swamp from which it must extricate
itself. Picking small increments, such as moving a small number of
emails into clouds, is useful but falls far short of the need to wipe
out thousands of silos.</P>
