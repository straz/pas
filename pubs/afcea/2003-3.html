Since CFOs do not know how to keep records they employed CIOs for data management (using write once/impossible to read ever coding methods). If a CFO found a property holder to be politically incorrect the records would be misread and the property defaulted to the CFO. That is how information management became an instrument of information politics.<p>In 1435 Johann Gutenberg invented printing technology.  He was the first systems integrator.  The trouble was that Gutenberg decided to put monks out of business because he believed that information technology is here to increased productivity.  Gutenberg died as a pauper when he could not get a budget appropriation from the employers of the monks. Gutenberg was forced into bankruptcy. This is an example how information politics influences the success of information technology.<p>The first time the title CIO was used anywhere was in 1980.  BillSynnott was then the head of Management Information Systems at theBank of Boston where the CFO had complete control over IBM mainframes.When loan officers arranged to get their own DEC minicomputers theyneeded somebody to legitimize their acquisitions.  They got BillSynnott promoted to the same level as the CFO and anointed him withthe title of CIO for better effect.  This is an example howinformation politics influences the careers of informationtechnologists.<p>These three episodes define the CIO power games in a long history. Inmost cases there are usually only two players, the CFO and the CIO.Now let's see how these games are played in the real world.<p><h3>Three Political Propositions</h3>To understand the CIO power games I offer three propositions that guide the talk about CIO Power Politics:<p><blockquote><dl><dt><b>First proposition:</b> Installing information technology is the continuation of bureaucratic conflicts by other means (as inspired by Clausewitz). <p><dt><b>Second proposition:</b> Information technology corrodes bureaucracy and therefore will be always opposed.<p><dt><b>Third proposition:</b> All great ideas about information technologies degrade into budgets. <p></dl></blockquote>The primary focus of a CIO is not to program, not to operatecomputers, not to make technical choices.  The primary job is powerpolitics - to play several different roles simultaneously. The job isto manage conflict, to oversee the re-distribution of power and tore-allocate money so that information technologies may support the successof an organization.<p>Power politics is a professional job.  It is not for amateurs,visionaries and certainly not for people whose sole expertise is incomputers.  A politician is a diversified professional who isnevertheless subject to a discipline and to rules of conduct.  A goodpolitician is able to operate in several different arenas simultaneously. <p>The only way a politician can win is to execute plays according to therules that reduce the uncertainty of the political games.<p><h3>Information Politics Is A Game With Only Few Rules</h3> Chief financial officers have accounting principles, employ methods offinancial analysis, are subject to generally accepted financialreporting practices, follow regulated reporting of accounts andoperate within a defined structure consisting of analysts,accountants, auditors, timekeepers and treasurers.  CFOs have toqualify for their position through certification andaccreditation.<p>The power of a CFO is defined by the extent of their oversight overinvestments and budgets.  The power of the CFO is also derived fromlegal and fiduciary accountability.  CFOs can go to jail formalfeasance.  The reason the CFO is politically powerful is becausethey are surrounded by more enforceable codes of conduct than anybodyelse in an organization. <p>The conduct of an Army General Officer is regulated by doctrine, byelaborate code of conduct, regulations, precedents, traditions andwarfare skills. To become a General one must pass through a gruelingprocess of evaluation, education and peer appraisals.  The power of aGeneral is measured by lethality; influence over weapons and controlover people.  Generals who mess up can be court-martialed.  Generalshave power because of the enormous discipline that is imposed by therules that surround their position.<p>Contrast this with the power of a CIO.  There are hardly any acceptedpractices.  There is no body of professional conduct that isenforceable.  There is no code of ethics, accreditation orcertification as to qualifications.  Law and regulations are missingas compared with laws and regulations of otherprofessions. (Clinger-Cohen is mostly concerned with acquisitionpractices). The CIO cannot possibly win because the informationtechnology plays are changing faster than the scenery in which a fewattempted regulations that are now emerging.  This is reflected in themisunderstandings about what are the real rules by which the CIO gamesare played.  As result, even the brightest CIOs have only a slimchance of winning.  In a game without rules there cannot be anywinners since there is no way of keeping the score. <p><h3>Description Of Three CIO Games</h3> The objective of this presentation is to describe where and how theCIO power moves are acted out.  My purpose is to set out the playfieldso that we can finally start understanding what the CIO job is allabout.  The purpose is to offer an understanding of actions whichotherwise would not make much sense to most executives.  My view ofmost of the CIO jobs is that what we have here is like a bull fightwhere only the bulls knows what to do, but neither the toreador, thematador nor the spectators know exactly what happens next.<p>For an understanding of CIO power plays one must realize that the CIO job is played out according to three scripts:<p><h3>The Technology CIO</h3>The first role of a CIO is in the form of the Technology CIO.  Thescope is limited to expenditures classified as I.T.  In the FederalGovernment this covers $56 billion of annual expense.  It amounts toonly 2.4% of the total Federal budget.  The U.S. industry median(I.T. budget/revenue ratio) is 3.4%.  That makes the CIO only a minorplayer when time comes to carve out budgets into allocations for allother players.<p>The reported spending numbers overstate a CIO's real power.  Often the personnel with the CIO title manage only a small headquarters staff.  At best the CIOs are empowered to veto a new procurement or to be accountable for cyber-attacks. <p>Technology CIOs have hardly any control over operations, maintenance,software development and communications costs that make up most of theI.T. spending.  Once money is appropriated it is the Program Mangersand Departmental Heads who dispense the money.  The Technology CIO is,in fact, a custodian who has the responsibility for fixing whatever isattributable as a computer failure, such as viruses, computer downtime,loss of data as well as coping with occasional scares such as whenthere are two missing zeros in calendar dates. Needless to say, the technology CIO can never win any popularity contests because theomnipresent email failures make them automatically culpable forone of the most frustrating workplace experiences. <p>Technology CIOs are engaged mostly in power plays for wrestlinggreater control from existing holders of information technologyassets. Such games are usually in the form of centralizationvs. decentralization contests or owned vs.  outsourcing acrimony.These games are played as encounters of techies vs.  techies (a formof civil war).  The net score is usually a zero sum gain.  Rare casesof success occur only when a CIO delivers results on a faster schedulethan dictated by the next reorganization occurrence (which averages 24months or less).<p>The job of the technology CIO holds great promise in the future asintegrator of an enormous variety of services delivered over networks.I do not see the technology CIO of the future occupied with softwaredevelopment contracts, setting up servers, worrying about desktopoutsourcing and legacy systems migration.  The customers are onlyinterested in what shows up on their graphic display. They could notcare less about how the information got there.  The technology CIOwill therefore have to rely on competing vendors to deliver usableinformation products to points of use.  My model of the future CIOrole is closer to that of a Wal-Mart store manager who has to makesure that competitively priced merchandise is always available.<p>Therefore, the technology CIO has to get out of the informationmanufacturing business and become a distributor of useful information.The technology CIO will continue to be important as a power plantmanager or the supermarket manager. Those jobs are important but notat a sufficient level to make CIO one of the decision-makingactors. <p>The roles of the technology CIO will rise as information technologybudgets increase and the choices of technology become critical to howan organization can compete. The technology CIOs have only one choiceof how to acquire political power. They must upgrade themselves frompurely technological concerns into the much wider scope of influencewhich is in information management. <p><h3>The Information Resources CIO</h3>The second role of a CIO is in the form of the Information ResourcesCIO.  Information Resources are over 30% of the total Federal budget(and often greater than the costs of direct labor in commercialcases.)  Information Resources include the cost of the Federal CivilService as well as all non-combat personnel in the Armed Forces.  Anefficient Information Resources CIO can earn their pay throughbusiness process streamlining and by promoting simplification ofinformation workflows. The scope of such efforts is somewhat definedby regulations, such as the Paperwork Reduction Act (ineffective), theRecords Management Act (unenforceable) and as defined by OMB when theycall for business process improvement which must precede allinformation technology investment business cases (a heroic objective).Information resources management is a great job if the office holdersand administrators will let you do it.<p>The typical power plays in this arena are efforts to achievestandardization and to deliver consolidation of functions, such as the40 years' worth of attempts to install a uniform financial system forDoD or to make sure, for example, why the Marine Corps and the AirForce ought to use the identical communication protocols for executingclose air support mission.<p>The actual role an Information Resources CIO is allowed to playdepends very much on the personality of the incumbents and on powerpolitics.  Embedded bureaucracies jealously guard their businessprocesses. These are welded into place by decades of regulations,administrative procedures, precedents, unions and customs.  <p>The Information Resources CIO is only welcome when one bureaucracy haswon one of the frequent centralization vs. decentralization contestsand then proceeds to rivet in place a new process in place using thestrongest bonding that is available: a multi-million dollar softwareprogram that is for all practical purposes not replaceable nor evenmodifiable except by spending money on yet another multi-millionsoftware upgrade.  <p>The transformation from the Technology CIO to an Information CIO isessentially a political act where the CIO becomes a key player inreengineering information flows and in streamlining decisionprocesses.  In this capacity the Information CIOs assume the rolescomparable to that of industrial efficiency experts.  Industrialengineers held dominant management positions for over 50 years since1900 as the USA became the most efficient industrial power.Industrial engineers still hold important jobs, but their position isnow taken for granted (and has migrated to factoriesin the Pacific rim).  They are now rarely seen as holding politicalpower.<p><h3>The Information Strategy CIO</h3>The third role of a CIO is in the form of the Information Strategy CIO.  This scope remains largely undefined, though here and there you detect initiatives that look at the missions of information technology beyond costs and budgets and towards organizational effectiveness through transformation of how the business of Government should be conducted. <p> Information technology based strategies now appear in the form ofinformation warfare (my hero is Duane Andrews, who institutionalizedthis concept in 1991), and as E-Gov initiatives (my hero is MarkForeman).  Information technology strategy can slo be seen insupply-chain integration projects and B-to-B commerce initiatives -just to offer a few examples.<p>Information strategy thinking takes place when the scope of the CIOextends beyond operating the internal information infrastructure of anenterprise and when it deals with goals, objectives and performance ofthe entire organization in a hostile competitive setting.  <p>A Strategic CIO views information technologies as reaching beyond theboundaries of an organization. It includes the interactions withsuppliers, customers as well as competitors (often defined asadversaries or enemies). When strategic management becomes a CIO role,the arena of information politics of the Federal CIOs would extend toevery element of a Department or Agency. This would include anexamination how information technologies can improve services totaxpayers, how to confuse adversaries by counter-intelligence and howto deliver greater lethality into enemies.<p><h3>The Importance Of Strategy</h3>The most significant insight about the relative importance of therespective roles of the Technology CIO, the Information Resources CIOand the Strategic CIO come from the research work done by theStrategic Planning Institute of Cambridge, Mass.  Over a decadein-depth studies were conducted which tried to identify whichvariables would analytically explain success or failure of businessfirms.  These studies ended up with the following conclusion:commercial success is in over 65% of cases associated with strategicmoves and only 15% of the causes of success were attributable tosuperior efficiency alone, as compared with competitors. <p>Information warfare is now everywhere.  The competition betweenWal-Mart and K-Mart was waged as information warfare (K-Mart lost eventhough it could use the identical technologies as applied by WalMart).The fight between Folger's coffee vs. Maxwell House coffee for groceryshelf space was information warfare pure and simple.  As I see it thecurrent worldwide protests against globalization are nothing but anexpression of anxiety that US corporations could dominate the worldeconomically through advanced uses of information as a commercialweapon.<p>This suggests that there is only a limited amount of benefit that canbe gained from concentrating on I.T. efficiencies by trying to cut thecosts of information technologies.  There is only a limited amount ofcash that can be extracted from worrying about cost reductions suchas server consolidation, upgrading operating systems and consolidatingpayroll processing (by all means do that).<p>Yet, that is where the contemporary CIOs spend most of their time.There is not that much to be gained with yet another desktopoutsourcing (taking dirty and torn wash and throwing it over the fencewhile expecting shiny new laundry in return) or enterprise-widesoftware licensing programs (for homogenized discounts) if oneconsiders the enormous penalties to business function from abortedprograms and failed acquisitions.<p><h3>Summary Of CIO Roles</h3>The Technology CIO controls about 2 - 3 % of the budget (at best). The ideal Information Resources CIO is supposed to oversee about 30% of the budget.  The Strategy CIO would participate in increasing the effectiveness of the entire organization.  Clearly, this means that the scope, priorities and attention of CIO power politics should shift from low-yielding cost reduction opportunities to high-yielding strategic advantages.  The Technology CIO must refocus in order to fulfill the Strategy CIO roles. <p>One should not despair about the fact that most government CIOs are still bogged down in political haggling over who controls 2-3% of costs.  After all, the CFOs with real power and clout - who nowadays sit around the table when 100% of budgets are allocated - used to be ordinary cashiers 100 years ago with hardly any discretionary power.  It takes time to rise from a cashier to a CFO.  It may take another few decades for the CIO label to acquire the influence of a true Chief Information Officer.<p><h3>The Strategic Importance Of The CIO</h3>I take the position that the role of the CIO in the information age should be equivalent to that of the CFO.  Economics dictates such comparison.  CFOsvalue only dead assets, such as property, cash, computers, telephone switches, weapons, buildings and land.  The fact that an enterprise is populated by live, educated and trained people who depend on information is never reflected in anything a CFO reports according to the FinancialAccounting Standards.<p>For CIOs to rise in power calls for freeing themselves from thefrequently morbid fascination with material assets, such as computers,servers, routers, switches and peripherals.  The CIO focus must nowshift to an examination of how an organization acquires trustedintelligence, how personnel can obtain the skills to make use ofinformation technologies and how know-how is communicated to be timelyand relevant.  CIOs must start focusing on creating what I call theKnowledge Capital of a living organization. CIOs should leave to CFOsto deal with dead Financial Capital.  <p>Let me illustrate this point:  <p>The Financial Capital valuation of a corporation, as reported by the CFO, reflects only the book value - or simply stated what a firm is worth if it is liquidated (that's "carcass" caluation).<p>The Knowledge Capital valuation of a corporation reflects its earningcapacity, after all expenses (including the costs of debty andshareholder capital) are paid for.  If a firm prospers, the KnowledgeCapital will be worth a large multiple of the Financial Capital.<p>The Financial Capital valuation of an armored division, as reported by the DoD comptroller would be the book value of the tanks, the equipment and the base housing.  The Knowledge Capital valuation of an armored division would be the complete reconstitution costs of fielding, organizing and motivating a brand new fighting force, including the cost of recruiting and training, plus intelligence capabilities, plus all of the command and control.  <p>I have published Knowledge Capital-to-Financial Capital ratios forthousands of U.S. and European firms.  The evidence is overwhelmingthat what the CFO's are accounting for is less than half what a firmis worth.  Successful organizations - without exception - show thatKnowledge Capital always exceeds Financial Capital by a largemultiplier.  I have every reason to believe that organizations such asNASA or the Department of Defense are worth much more in terms of theKnowledge Capital than what is shown in terms of the Congressionalbudgetary projections.<p><h3>Summary Conclusions </h3>The implications of these observations on the conduct of the CIO job in the next 20-30 years are far reaching.  Here are my conclusions:<p><ol><li>The Technology CIO is a power politics dead-end.  Vendors and suppliers can do that job better and cheaper than government will be ever able to deliver. The Federal government cannot possibly match the technology resources and capabilities of the firms now emerging as suppliers of the information infrastructure and providers of network transaction services at a marginal cost that takes advantage of economies of scale and innovation.<p>Except in cases that are mission-unique the ownership of data centers,of servers or applications should be shifted to suppliers oftransaction services, on demand, any time and any place.  The vendorsare the ones who are doing their very best to increase the risks ofobsolescence of whatever they are selling. Therefore it should be thevendors, not the customers, to carry the technology risks. <p><li>The Information Resource CIO power play is a necessary activityand should offer good career opportunities because it deliversincremental efficiencies that operating executives like.  Likeindustrial engineers, the information resource CIO will continue tofunction in an essential, but nevertheless subordinate role.  Ininformation-based competition, effectiveness is required forcompetitive survival.<p><li>The power base a CIO ought to aspire to attain is that of a Strategy CIO.  No amount of computer efficiency can compensate for fundamental flaws in strategy that leaves competitors with superior information-based capabilities.<p><li>The power base of the strategic CIO of the future must be based on the creation and protection of Knowledge, not the ownership of computer and software assets.  Information security thus becomes the mainstay of the legitimacy of a Strategic CIO because information assets can be easily corrupted, stolen or become obsolete.  In the same way as the CFO now derives power from having to certify that the accounts are correct, so I expect that the CIO will have to certify very soon that the Knowledge Capital assets of an enterprise are in safe and well protectedin the custody of a professional cadre of experts.<p></ol>The roles of the vendors and contractors is then to make it easy forthe CIOs to upgrade themselves from the current pre-occupation withinformation technologies to the transformation of this job to aposition of leadership in bringing information technologies as asuccess-enabler for the entire enterprise.<p>The message to strategy-minded CIOs is: go and acquire the power toguide the accumulation and protection of Knowledge Capital assets -data, information and intelligence - that serve customers and help todefeat our adversaries. <p><h3>CIOs - As General Officers</h3> Information technology is the weapon of choice in 21st centurycompetition, whether it is military or commercial.  The CIOs muststart viewing themselves as General Officers whose purpose is tomaintain the overwhelming lead of the United States of America in theapplications of information technologies.<p>The legitimacy of the political power of strategic CIOs is therefore amatter of national importance, not exclusively of only enhancing apersonal career.  I pray that we have the wisdom to bring into theservices of the U.S. government the next generation of CIOs who willsee their vocation in that way.<p><hr><i>back to <a href="http://www.strassmann.com">strassmann.com</a></i></body></html>
