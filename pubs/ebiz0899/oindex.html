Strassmann has been a partisan for 55 years, and he still enjoys the work

<p><b><font color="#214E6C"><font size=+3>P</font></font></b>aul Strassmann,
CEO of The Software Testing Assurance Corp. in New Canaan, CT, is still
a partisan, a fervent supporter of causes--in this case, his view that
today's executives are spending far too much money on information technology.
According to Strassmann, senior corporate executives refuse to acknowledge
that there is no demonstrable relationship between computer spending and
corporate profits.
<p>The youthful-looking, 70-year-old Strassmann appears to be an unlikely
partisan. He has merry eyes and wavy hair brushed back from his high forehead,
and he wears a tweed sports jacket and casual shirt and slacks. He has
lived with his wife, Mona, an artist and head of the family-owned publishing
company, The Information Economics Press, on the same five acres of rolling,
tree-shaded, hills in New Canaan for 29 years.
<p>Strassmann has converted the guest house into offices, where, in one
of the smaller rooms, he sits barefoot at a computer and composes his warnings
to the corporate universe about the resources they are squandering on IT.&nbsp;
<p>"It has become an arms' race," Strassmann says, his voice tinged with
a note of amused outrage. "And it is fueled by the media and the computer
industry, always pushing for companies to make fancier and fancier acquisitions,
without keeping their eyes focused on the bottom line. The actual cost
of a computer is only part of what a company pays to own one. I paid approximately
$2,400 for my desktop. However, given my consulting fee, my monthly cost
for recovering from crashes, holding the phone to my ear while waiting
for a technician to answer at a help desk and straightening out software
glitches, [the total cost] far exceeds what I paid for the computer."
<p>Strassmann's objection is not simply the total-cost-of-ownership argument.
Rather, he maintains that businesses have not considered their IT spending
in the context of their overall operations, from a philosophical point
of view, evaluating their precise needs and tailoring their budgets to
meet them instead of blindly following their competitors.
<p>Strassmann has a wide range of interests in the relationship between
business and technology. He has outspokenly deplored the lack of network
security in corporate America. But his passionate convictions about the
wastefulness of corporate IT spending have been churning and, occasionally,
erupting for more than two decades.&nbsp;

He has written roughly 150 articles on information management and the productivity
of information workers, along with several books that explore various aspects
of the subject. His <i>Information Payoff: The Transformation of Work in
the Electronic Age</i> (The Information Economics Press, 1985) is currently
in its 10th printing and appears in Japanese, Russian, Italian and Brazilian
translations. Another book, <i>The Business Value of Computers</i> (The
Information Economics Press, 1990), took dead aim at wasteful IT practices.&nbsp;
<p>Like any true partisan, Strassmann pursues his trade inside occupied
territory. He has been working the high-tech terrain since 1954, shortly
after earning an engineering degree from Cooper Union in New York City.
Quite by chance his first job after graduation was at a firm that played
a major role in designing the New Jersey Turnpike. One day his boss stopped
by Strassmann's drafting table and mentioned that the state was having
trouble with traffic jams at the highway toll booths. He asked Strassmann
if he could see if something could be done.
<p>"I was delighted," recalls Strassmann. "I was told to use a computer
to explore the situation. They let me play with it day and night. I had
the Turnpike's punch-card toll receipts, and I fed them into the computer
and analyzed traffic patterns. It turned out that the problem was caused
by the faulty scheduling of the toll collectors. I reworked the schedules
and cleared up the traffic congestion. Best of all, I received a thorough
introduction to computers and began what would become my career."
<p>Strassmann's first CIO position was with the General Foods Corp. (now
known as Kraft Foods, headquartered in Northfield, IL). He then moved to
Kraft and, finally, joined <b>Xerox Corp.</b>, Stamford, CT, in 1969 as
director of administration and information systems.
<p><img SRC="0822.gif" ALT="0822" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=1 BORDER=0 height=239 width=286 align=RIGHT>
"Department heads had to submit their IT budgets to me for approval," says
Strassmann. "Previously, the budget submissions were a formality, an opportunity
for an IT executive to use a rubber stamp. But I began to study the budgets
and to ask the department heads why they were buying certain equipment
and services, to find out what value they would add to the bottom line.
I turned down some of the requests and started reaching beyond the circumscribed
role of IT glass and plastic into financial areas. It didn't make me popular
with certain Xerox executives."
<p>But it made him popular enough with upper management that Strassmann
spent the rest of his corporate career there, serving as general manager
of the company's Information Services Division and as vice president of
strategic planning for the Information Products Group, with responsibility
for strategic investments, acquisitions and product plans involving the
corporation's electronic businesses. He also played a key role in shaping
Xerox's strategy for office automation and developed new methods for evaluating
the productivity of computer investments.&nbsp;
<p>After his retirement from Xerox in 1985, Strassmann became an author,
lecturer and consultant to companies such as <b>AT&amp;T</b>, <b>General
Electric</b> and <b>IBM</b> as well as a visiting professor at the University
of Connecticut and the Imperial College in London.
<p>One of his other clients, General Motors Corp., Detroit, hired him to
benchmark its IT costs. When Strassmann discovered ways for GM to cut its
spending, he impressed GM Vice Chairman Donald Atwood, who would soon be
serving as a deputy to Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney. Atwood invited
Strassmann to help out at the Defense Department (DOD), and, in March 1991,
Strassmann was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command,
Control, Communications and Intelligence.&nbsp;

At the DOD, Strassmann served as the principal deputy to Assistant Secretary
of Defense Duane Andrews. In that role, Strassmann got the chance to make
his long-developed dream of streamlining IT infrastructure a reality. Strassmann
was responsible for organizing and overseeing the information management
program throughout the DOD. He oversaw policy and was responsible for an
IT budget that exceeded $10 billion a year.&nbsp;
<p>Much of Strassmann's work at the Defense Department was classified,
and he declines to discuss it. But Andrews suggests what Strassmann achieved.&nbsp;
<p>"What Paul did at the DOD was pathfinding," says Andrews, who is now
an executive vice president at Science <b>Application International Corp.</b>,
an employee-owned, research-and-technology firm headquartered in San Diego.
"Before Paul, we had no way of judging the efficiency and costs of our
information management program. Paul changed all that and brought our program
to the level of our best corporations. Change in a bureaucracy is shocking
to a lot of people. It was a hard sell, but Paul got it done through force
of will. Much of what he designed is still in place. He certainly didn't
need the job at the DOD, and he could've made a lot more money elsewhere.
But he is a true patriot, and he wanted to give something back to his country."
<p>Under Strassmann's direction, the Pentagon saved $35 billion on IT.
For his efforts Strassmann was awarded the Defense Medal for Distinguished
Public Service, the Defense Department's highest civilian award.
<p>The citation that Secretary of Defense Cheney presented to Strassmann
states: "[He conceived and implemented] a vision of a more efficient and
effective information infrastructure to support the combat soldier." To
this end he, the citation continues, "spearheaded the largest information
management program ever conceived."&nbsp;
<p>"Working at the DOD was one of the most rewarding experiences of my
life," says Strassmann. "Although I was a civilian, I believe that the
military personnel respected me because I had been shot at. I made closer
friends there than at any other place I have worked."
<p>Strassmann has remained involved with the military, serving as an adjunct
professor at West Point and at the School of Information Warfare at the
National Defense University (NDU) at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C.
<p>By the time Strassmann closed up shop at the Defense Department and
returned to his desk in New Canaan, technology was covering nearly every
desk in corporate offices and every lap in business-class. He considered
this development a runaway beast, and he continued to publish warnings
through The Information Economics Press. In 1993, he published <i>The Politics
of Information Management</i>, and, in 1997, his magnum opus on the subject,
<i>The Squandered Computer</i>.

In these works, Strassmann establishes how much money corporations are
wasting on technology and he offers specific remedies for the disease.
In case he wasn't getting enough attention with his weighty dissections
of IT, he and cartoonist John Klossner threw some lighter jabs in his <i>Irreverent
Dictionary of Information Politics</i> (The Information Economics Press,
1995). In that book Strassmann observed that artificial intelligence is
"the expensive automation of tasks previously done cheaply with judgment."
Local area network is defined as: "Costly efforts by enthusiastic amateurs
seeking intellectual challenge, improved resumes and indispensability."
<p>Strassmann has earned his share of other kudos as well. In 1992, he
received the Award for Achievement from the Association for Federal Information
Resource Management. In 1996, he was given the Excellence Award for Business
Engineering, and, in 1997, he was named to the CIO Hall of Fame by <i>CIO
Magazine</i>.&nbsp;
<p>He has also won high praise for his insights into IT management. As
Michael Schrage observed in the September/October 1997 issue of the <i>Harvard
Business Review</i>, "It would be wrong to dismiss Strassmann as a cynic
or a corporate neo-Luddite. On the contrary, he comes off as a wounded
idealist . . . [But anyone] who has gone through Economics 101 and a basic
statistics course will find Strassmann's math a provocative and welcome
antidote to popular media coverage, which regularly attributes 1,000% returns
to intranet investments . . . No one denies--including Strassmann--that
computerization and creative networking can add enormous value. But when
we look at the numbers, it is clear that companies are not basing their
computer investments on careful calculations of returns or added value."
<p>Since many corporations are still spending enormous amounts of money
on IT, there are plenty of decisionmakers who are ignoring Strassmann's
message.
<p>No matter. It is pleasant work, for the most part, and Strassmann finds
that being a partisan now is far easier than in 1944, when he was first
introduced to the trade. At least now he gets to work in the daytime. And
no one is trying to kill him.
<p>Strassmann was born in 1929, in the ancient city of Trencin, in a country
that you can no longer find on a map. The country was Czechoslovakia, a
troubled child of World War I. Yet despite the disputes that at times flared
up between Czech- and Slovak-speaking peoples, the Czechoslovak Republic
entered a 20-year phase of prosperous democracy.
<p>The Strassmanns prospered right along with their nation. Paul's father
was a successful Jewish businessman. His mother worked as the cashier in
her husband's store and she kept a kosher home. Trencin was a former Roman
military colony with a hilltop castle overlooking the city streets, and
Strassmann's father had been a battalion commander during WWI, a remarkable
position for a Jew to achieve in that time and place.

Strassmann enjoyed the pleasures of upper middle-class life until the age
of 10, when Adolph Hitler turned his eyes eastward in a greedy search for
<i>lebensraum</i>. In February 1939, the Czech president dismissed the
Slovak government, giving Hitler his excuse to invade, and Czechoslovakia
was again divided.
<p>Czech partisans rebelled against the occupation, but Hitler sent in
SS General Reinhard Heydrich to crush the resistance. In the spring of
1942, Czech partisans, with the assistance of British agents, assassinated
Heydrich. The Nazi reprisals were brutal. More than 1,300 Czechs were executed,
including all the male inhabitants of one village, which was then burned
and dynamited.
<p>Strassmann's father was part of the Slovak Resistance, and he was captured
and killed by the Germans. Strassmann's mother was deported to a concentration
camp. He never saw her again. Strassmann disappeared into the hills and
became a partisan.&nbsp;
<p>At first, the teenager watched the movements of the Nazis and reported
their deployment to his commander. Soon, though, Strassmann was transformed
into a nocturnal creature with a deadlier occupation. He was assigned to
disrupt the Nazi supply system, and he accomplished this task by hiding
during the day and then sneaking out after su nset to blow up railroad
tracks and trains. He recalls, with some pride, being shot at frequently
by German soldiers.&nbsp;
<p>At the end of the war, Communist forces took over the government--and
held on to power until 1989. Four years later, the country was divided
into two independent states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Strassmann,
not yet 20 years old, made his way to the United States via France and
England.&nbsp;
<p>He arrived in New York City with little money and speaking Slovak, Russian
and German. He learned English by finding an American girlfriend and studying
at a special program for refugees at the City College of New York. During
the day, he worked on his high-school diploma, and, since the booming postwar
economy had no need for disciplined saboteurs, Strassmann earned a living
selling socks.
<p>"I heard about Cooper Union and wondered how college could cost nothing,"
says Strassmann, unaware at the time that the school had been founded by
Peter Cooper, a poor boy who became one of the grand entrepreneurs of the
Gilded Age and left behind a financial legacy to ensure that immigrants
and the working class could receive an education. "So I went over there
and spoke to an admissions' officer, Dr. Watson. I learned that tuition
was free, but you needed about $100 for lab fees and $45 to take the aptitude
test for admission. Dr. Watson wasn't optimistic about my chances, but
he took pity on me and said that he would give me the aptitude test. I
flunked the English part, but got a perfect score on the math, and I was
put on the waiting list. The following September, Dr. Watson called my
rooming house to say they had an opening in civil engineering."
<p>Strassmann finished second in his class at Cooper Union and to this
day he treasures a remark that Dr. Watson later made to him: "He told me,"
says Strassmann, "that I wrecked his selection criteria."
<p>Strassmann not only set his career in motion at Cooper Union, he met
his wife, Mona, who was studying art at the college. They have been married
for the last 44 years.
<p><b>Lion in summer</b>
<p>Now, during the final summer of the 20th century, Paul Strassmann's
favorite target of opportunity is still the profligate corporate spending
on technology. "In the United States, in 1995," he says, "businesses spent
nearly $500 billion on computers--a figure that exceeded corporate profits
by $175 billion [aggregate statistics come from all public companies that
report their results to the Securities and Exchange Commission]. The truth
is that despite a 67% growth in computer spending, overhead costs to American
businesses grew faster than either revenue or profits. It seems as though
a large number of corporate decision-makers have forgotten that their customers
don't give a damn which accounting package they are using.
<p>"The problem," continues Strassmann, "is that so many companies are
trying to discover the proper level of spending on computers. There is
no proper way. The spending should be reflective of the bureaucratic make-up
of the company."
<p>In <i>The Squandered Computer</i>, Strassmann offers 152 recommendations
to CEOs and IT professionals on how to avoid the technology-spending trap.
One of the more interesting points he makes is that when companies evaluate
their returns on IT investments, they should do so by calculating the costs
of automation versus the next least-expensive solution.
<p>As Strassmann talks you can see the traces of pleasure and sadness in
his eyes. The interview has given him an occasion to recall the strange,
bloody history of his childhood, his good luck in the United States and
the reliance on analytical rigor that has led this partisan to stand up
to corporate popular opinion, in the hope that businessmen will have the
willingness to understand.&nbsp;
<p>"The exuberant business spending on computers is almost over," says
Strassmann. "Economic necessity will win out over electronics."*
