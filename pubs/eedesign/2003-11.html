<h2>Alinean Research Shows How to Manage IT Investing for Higher ROI</h2>



<h3>Alinean Research Director Paul Strassmann
To Present Newest Findings at IDC's Flagship Event in Europe</h3>

ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- New research by Alinean, the
ROI consultancy, highlights that IT budget battles will confront yet
another challenging year, in part, because corporate profitability has
declined in the last two years. Because of tightened budgets from
prior years, IT departments have already reduced IT costs through
consolidation and cutbacks. While this inward focus on total cost of
ownership (TCO) has reduced IT spending, the concentration on
technology costs alone has led to overlooked opportunities to reduce
corporate transaction costs, such as administrative overhead -- a much
larger share of overall expenditures.<P>

The best remedy, as highlighted in the research, is to focus IT
spending and business investments on administrative expenses -- known
as sales, general, and administrative costs (SG&A) -- which have been
surprisingly resistant to cost reductions. In fact, SG&A expenses have
not matched the decline in direct costs over the past seven years,
according to Paul Strassmann, the former CIO of NASA, Department of
Defense, Xerox and Kraft Foods, who was responsible for the Alinean
research project.<p>

Strassmann will present the Alinean findings at the IDC European IT
Forum 2003, being held in Paris this week.

"Companies are focusing too much on information technology and not
sufficiently on the productivity of the people who use the
technology," said Strassmann, whose presentation at IDC's flagship CEO
and CIO forum will include several actionable recommendations for
shifting attention to corporate productivity results.<p>

"IT investing should focus on driving business process improvements
and efficiency," he continued. "And when it comes to cutting
operational costs, SG&A is the top target, because it offers
significant opportunities to boost the efficiency of all information
resources."<p>

Strassmann and Alinean examine the financial performance and
information spending of over 10,000 publicly held companies worldwide
every quarter. Their three key recommendations are:<P>

<ol>
<li> Invest IT with an eye towards reducing information management expenses,
streamlining how an organization functions.<P>


<li> Leverage selective outsourcing to focus on core competencies and
minimize risks of deploying increasingly complex information networks.<p>

Substituting managed services for company-specific investments will
undoubtedly appear on the agenda of CFO budget reviews for 2004.<p>

Recommending the right IT investment strategies will require improved
methods of quantitative analysis for gaining an understanding of long-
term implications for the business.<P>


<li> Strategically, begin investing in new technologies that increase the
value of corporate "Knowledge Capital." Strassmann shows that the worth
of assets not reported on the corporate financial accounts now exceeds
the financial shareholder equity by a large multiplier.<P>

</ol>


<h3>Why SG&A Costs Remain High</h3>

Throughout the prosperous, high-spending years of the late '90s and
the more recent periods when companies' revenue has faltered, the
ratio of SG&A expenses and IT costs has remained constant, bringing
claims of productivity improvement from IT into question.<p>

Many CEOs and other financial stakeholders have found that IT
spending, which averages 3.5 percent of revenue, has not sufficiently
offset SG&A spending, which represents between 19 and 23 percent of
revenue.<p>

IT investment doesn't always deliver the expected efficiency gains,
often because of non-technical issues, including management focus,
training, user adoption and competing business priorities. At the same
time, the widespread trend to establish enterprise-wide platforms has
led many companies to jettison silo-specific legacy applications,
creating a build-and-junk cycle whereby old investments that have not
achieved expected pay-offs are replaced with newer platforms, which
restarts the ROI clock yet again.<p>

"The greatest opportunity for reducing SG&A expenses is to simplify
business processes and weed out redundant workflow," said
Strassmann. "Technology can be a catalyst and enabler of such gains,
but its benefits must be quantified and monitored to ensure
results. In short: In the age of information the firm with the
greatest productivity of its total information resources can be
expected to be the winner in the global competitive races of the
forthcoming decades."<P>
