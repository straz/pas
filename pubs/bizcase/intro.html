<h2>BizCase As the Key to<br>
Alignment of Information Technologies</h2>


"Aligning information systems to corporate goals" has emerged as the number
one management issue for 1992, 1995, 1996 as well as the number two
management issue for 1993 and 1994 in a poll of 500 information systems
executives.<p>

How does one demonstrate that information technologies are <b>aligned</b> with
the business plans of an enterprise? Recognizing that all <b>alignment</b>
efforts are a contested process, how does one make it constructive and
verifiable?  How does one remove from any disputes the biases that are
always present when competition takes place for new project funds? How do
computer proponents deal with probing inquiries from financial executives
if it has become increasingly clear that information management is not
primarily a technological  but a scarce resources allocation issue?<p>

To line up information technology plans with business plans requires the
adoption of the language, style and measures used in business planning. It
requires the use of consistent metrics to check whether the vision, faith
and technological accomplishments contribute to the measurable goals of the
enterprise.  While companies may pay lip service to customer satisfaction,
quality and other trendy indicators, they rarely evaluate how specific
information technology investments have influenced changes in non-financial
measures of performance. Meanwhile, CEOs still evaluate their companies the
old-fashioned way, on the basis of  profits.  Therefore, useful alignment
metrics must relate to accepted measures of financial performance.<p>

The BizCase package is a response to the top corporate executives' years of
frustration with poorly structured investment proposals. It is the absence
of a generally accepted standard investment evaluation practice that has
hindered the realization of the value of improvements through information
technology investments.<p>

The BizCase offers a consistent way of documenting the risk-adjusted
discounted cash flow of a proposed business improvement project. It
displays the high and low expected financial returns - elements that add to
the credibility of any planning effort, since every operating executive
realizes that changes in business processes are risky ventures. Most
importantly, BizCase  delivers analyses in a format that can be directly
translated into operating budgets and into financial plans. In this way,
operating executives can be held accountable for verifiable outcomes, as
by-products of conventional monthly and quarterly budget reports.<p>

<h2>BizCase as a Project Information System</h2>

All project plans are subject to change. Approval of a proposed investment
is the beginning of a continually widening drift between the stated
objectives as compared with the capacity to deliver the promised results.<p>

There are no plans that remains unchanged while a project is on its way.
Customers are always discovering new ways how to improve their operations.<p>

There are no resource commitments that remain fixed as the  scope of a
project changes and as new implementation problems are discovered. All cost
estimates and schedules for technology investments are uncertain. The
reception of business process innovations is subject to unexpected
challenges. This may come from hundreds of conceivable sources, such as
resistance to changes in operating procedures, difficulties in training
people or from outright sabotage from entrenched stake holders.<p>

The recriminations, misunderstandings and confusion that accompany project
reviews as they evolve from desirable plans into uncompromising reality
have undesirable consequences. Careers are destroyed. Budgets are summarily
cut. Projects are canceled because they are tagged as being "out of
control." The fault lies in the disconnect between what was assumed and
committed at conception of the project and what is found, controlled and
scheduled during the project execution. Project plans are defined in
general terms, because that is all that is known. The tracking of project
events during the execution is always detailed. Telescoping planning and
microscopic execution assures that conflicts will escalate as a project
progresses.<p>

BizCase offers a way how to maintain the project plans continually updated.
As conditions change, the assumptions and dependencies became available for
conforming examination and adjustment to reflect what has been learned.
That is perhaps the most important benefit of BizCase. It offers the
capacity to display a perspective that links goals, programs, measures of
performance, projections, expectations and actual results in a consistent
way.<p>

The BizCase software also links financial and performance objectives with
quality targets. It makes it practical to keep up with changes that allows
comparing actual  with promised results. Therefore, it qualifies as an EIS
(Executive Information System) for assessing the likely consequences of
improvement proposals as the project progresses.

<h2>A Short History of BizCase</h2>

The origins of BizCase can be traced to early 1988 when I wrote a program
that subsequently became Chapters 9 and 10 in my 1990 book 
<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/business-value.html">The Business Value
of Computers</a>. In July 1991 this method was introduced into the U.S.
Department of Defense as Functional Economic Analysis. It was embodied
into operational software largely as result of work done by the Institute
for Defense Analysis.<p>

Late in 1991 the CIM (Corporate Information Management) program of DoD made
Functional Economic Analysis  one of the primary underpinnings of its
ambitious business process reengineering effort. The CIM staff  became the
key proponents and movers in this endeavor and deserves the overwhelming
credit for linking formal project planning methods with formal structural
analysis (IDEF) techniques. The combination of Functional Economic Analysis
and Structural Analysis ultimately resulted in a stream of BPR (Business
Process Reeengineering) and Functional Process Improvement  techniques.
Many consultants participated in assisting  staffs throughout the
Department of Defense in taking advantage of these methods. More than 60
government organizations participated in these efforts, culminating in the
receipt of the coveted National Performance Review award in March 1996.<p>

The considerably world-class experience accumulated by the Systems Research
and Applications Corporation (SRA) during this period exceeds anything
available for private sector project managers. Although a number of
consultants offer versions of financial analytic programs derived from
experiences with machine tool investments, to my best knowledge none of
these techniques satisfy the needs for assessing the benefits, costs and
risks of large business process improvement ventures. It is this
understanding of the current state of the art that led me to encourage the
SRA organization to venture into applying their insights in the
construction of the BizCase software package.<p>
