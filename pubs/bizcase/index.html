<h2>Why BizCase<sup>tm</sup>?</h2>
<blockquote>
A major challenge facing managers is selecting the right projects to achieve 
corporate goals.  By clearly demonstrating how projects support strategic direction, 
<B><I>BizCase</I></B> software for Windows helps managers build a better business case.
<P>

<H4>Why do you need a business case?</H4>
The business case is a widely used management tool.  It states the formal argument 
for changing the way your business operates.  It helps answer questions like:
<UL>
<LI>Will new equipment really save us time and money?
<LI>What are the costs and benefits of introducing a new product?
<LI>How can we change our business rules to become more efficient?
<LI>The proposed information system looks promising -- but what are the risks?
</UL>

<H2>How does <B><I>BizCase</I></B> help you build a better business case?</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<H4>Align changes with strategic direction.</H4>
Before you start to think about what changes to consider, you need to know where 
you are headed (your goals).  In <B><I>BizCase</I></B>, you start to build your plan by defining 
goals.  Then you analyze different approaches (your strategies) for reaching 
those goals.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> focuses your attention on the strategies that will help you 
reach your goals.  All <B><I>BizCase</I></B> data are linked back to their effects on goals.
<P>
<H4>Track financial and nonfinancial measures of success.</H4>
Performance measures tell you if your changes are successful.  Dollars and cents 
donít always tell the whole story.  Often nonfinancial measures like quality and 
timeliness are more important than financial measures.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> ties your performance 
measures back to your goals.  It helps you track the appropriate mix of financial and 
nonfinancial measures.
<P>
<H4>Start at the top.  Add details later.</H4>
Analysis takes time.  If a summary-level analysis makes a compelling case for your 
proposed changes, does it make sense to add more details?  If you are making a large 
decision and adding details will improve the accuracy of the decision, then details 
are probably necessary.  On the other hand, if fine-tuning wonít help you make a better 
decision, then donít add details.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> starts at the top but allows you to expand 
your case to the appropriate level of detail.
<P>
<H4>Compare alternative plans for change.</H4>
There are almost always different ways to get the job done.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> helps you 
compare different approaches (alternatives) for changing your business.  By 
looking at the costs and benefits of more than one alternative, you can be more 
confident that you have selected the best approach.
<P>
<H4>Analyze the risk of your proposed changes.</H4>
Business cases, by definition, deal with uncertain outcomes.  The actual costs and 
benefits of your proposed changes may be higher or lower than expected.  Controlling 
risks begins with understanding them.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> helps you analyze and plan for the 
things that could go wrong with your projects.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> also shows you the financial 
consequences of uncertainty.
<P>
<H4>Use a complete toolset.  Work with tools you already know.</H4>
Some business planning software consists simply of templates for your word processor 
and spreadsheet.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> provides much more.  You can build the entire case using 
<B><I>BizCaseís</I></B> built-in text-processor and Excel-compatible spreadsheets. The <B><I>BizCase</I></B> 
calculation engine computes the financial results. 
<P>
If you like, you can develop parts of your case using standard Microsoft software, then 
import the results into <B><I>BizCase</I></B>.  You can import data from Excel spreadsheets or 
project plans.  Or you can use the <B><I>BizCase</I></B> Model Launcher to catalog and run any other 
supporting business model.  <B><I>BizCase</I></B> automatically produces a formatted Word document, 
containing key tables and graphs.
<P>
<H4>Learn from examples and guidance.</H4>
Navigating the <B><I>BizCase</I></B> software is easy.  If you have used other Windows programs, you 
probably wonít need much help learning the <B><I>BizCase</I></B> user interface.  Learning how to 
build a good business plan is more difficult.  Thatís why the software comes with a 
130 page book describing the business case concepts behind <B><I>BizCase</I></B>.  The book includes 
a 35 page case study that shows how to use <B><I>BizCase</I></B> to analyze a complex business problem.  
The case study is included as a file that you can open and examine using the <B><I>BizCase</I></B> 
software.  In addition, <B><I>BizCase</I></B> comes with a 50 page tutorial and a 200 page help 
system to help you learn the nuts-and-bolts of the <B><I>BizCase</I></B> software.
