<font size="+2">E</font><font size="+1">verything I've read about
"knowledge capital" or "knowledge management"</font> has devoted
inordinate attention to the accomplishments, methods and reporting
practices of Skandia Insurance Co.<p>

     What distinguishes the Swedish firm <A
HREF="http://www.computerworld.com/cwi/story/0,1199,NAV47_STO44247,00.html">[Business, March
27]</A> is its approach to measuring its intellectual capital. Its
techniques have been featured in its annual reports since 1994, with
details unmatched by any other firm. Skandia's image as a proponent of
innovative ideas has been reinforced by extensive publishing, public
speaking and promotions. This constitutes the centerpiece of its
efforts to create the image that it's one of the most sophisticated
firms in advancing new concepts of how to increase employee
productivity.<p>

To understand what Skandia is doing requires an immersion in
philosophies, metrics and classifications. One must become acquainted
with the fine distinctions of how to partition intellectual capital
into human capital, structural capital, organizational capital,
customer capital, innovation capital and process capital. To steer
through such subtleties, you must become proficient in using the
Skandia Navigator, the Skandia value scheme, flow-based models (a PC
software package called Dolphin) and, most important, the Skandia
Intellectual Capital Index, which aggregates more than 100 variables
into groupings such as the relationship capital index, the human
capital index, the infrastructure capital index and the innovation
capital index. A sampling of this collection would lead you to
discover just about every conceivable metric, such as employee
turnover, average years of service, change in the company's IT
literacy, PCs per employee and IT expense per employee.<p>


All the inputs are then passed through a series of equations that
establish such relationships as: Human Capital Base Value = Net
Present Value of Five Years' Payroll Costs.<p>

Unfortunately, how all this relates to company success isn't explicit.<p>

After having satisfied myself with Skandia's intellectual concepts,
I became curious about their effectiveness. Does all of this
inspirational thinking produce superior results?<p>


One way of judging a firm's performance is to compare its financial
record with those of its competitors. That's easy; analyzing Skandia's
size, revenue and industrial classification produced a list of 19
look-alike firms in five other countries. I settled on return on
shareholder equity (ROE) as the measure for assessing the productivity
of people and how well their talents were deployed for shareholders'
benefit.<p>


<P>The top-ranking firm was German insurer Aachener und Muenchener,
with a 1998 ROE of 48.4%. At the bottom was Victoria Holdings, also in
Germany, with 7.6%. Skandia ranked second from the bottom, with a
meager 8.2% - barely above the cost of capital. This isn't an
impressive performance for a firm that boasts about its leadership.<P>

I then took a closer look at Skandia's history to see if 1998 stood
out as a bad year. It didn't:<p>

 Compared with half its peer group,
Skandia has consistently underperformed in delivering superior
results.<P>

Many firms let their public relations enthusiasm exceed their
accomplishments. The stock market often rewards this enthusiasm with
share valuations that are higher than what their
plodding-but-profitable competitors get. But in due course, the
shortfalls are recognized and the firms are penalized when their
market worth nosedives.<P>

There's no substitute for delivering above-average financial
results as proof of competitive excellence.  <P>
