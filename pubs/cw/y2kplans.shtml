<font size="+2">M</font><font size="+1">any companies are assuring
the public</font> that they will be year 2000-compliant. But chances
are the same companies that are crowing today will have to eat crow in
January, when something fails anyway.  When that happens, some
unfortunate information technology executives will have lots of
explaining to do. How will they get themselves off the hook? Some plan
to fall back on the argument that software is inevitably flawed and
fallible. But that won't work. The only way to defend yourself is to
have a strong crisis contingency plan. And the best way to test one is
by adapting the military's long-used "war game" approach.<p>

Many IT executives will be tempted to plead that there's no such thing
as a sure software fix. After all, not even Bill Gates can get
software to function in a public demo.<p>

But executives, regulators and litigators aren't ready to accept the
software fallibility defense. You can't plead that you are blameless
if the risks are known and well-documented.<p>

Contingency plans and contingency rehearsals are mandatory. You can't
claim year 2000-readiness unless you have prepared contingency plans,
rehearsed their implementation and demonstrated how your organization
would cope.<p>

But how do you come up with a reliably tested plan? There's an entire
discipline built around testing software, but nothing similar exists
for proving that your contingency plans don't have a fatal flaw.<p>

Year 2000 risks have similarities to the situations one encounters
when trying to neutralize national security threats. The best way to
check out how the military copes with disabling situations is to learn
from cases in which contingency plans worked and from those in which
they failed. What national security organizations call "war gaming"
develops knowledge on how to prepare to cope with threats before they
become disasters. All year 2000 contingency plans involving critical
services &#151; especially where there's potential loss of life &#151;
should be subject to such gaming exercises.<p>

In such a game, the "white hats" would be the year 2000 management
team. The "black hats" would be experienced professionals with
industry-specific experience, who would try to wreck the neat
assumptions in the contingency plan. The black hats must think of all
the improbable combinations that could happen coincidentally, making
systems fail on a massive scale.<p>

To stage a year 2000 war game, the white hats must disclose their
plans to the black hats. The game is then played in eight-hour rounds,
assuming a start at midnight on Dec. 31, 1999. For starters, the
attackers would confront the defenders with a failure scenario for
which there is no preplanned solution. It would then be up to the year
2000 management team to demonstrate, in less than 30 minutes, how it
would get out of that situation. At the end of each round, a referee
would judge which side prevailed. Such an exercise could be completed
in a day and would generate a survival rating about the organization's
prospects of coping with problems during the first week of 2000.<p>

Much has been written about year 2000 as being a technical &#151; as
well as an organizational &#151; problem. But hardly anything has been
said about how to make contingency plans verifiable. It's time to
explore conceivable scenarios that soon may be encountered as real
predicaments. If a year 2000 management team can survive the
challenges of independent black hat professionals, that alone may be
adequate proof of "due diligence," even if some improbable mishap ends
up in litigation. <p>
