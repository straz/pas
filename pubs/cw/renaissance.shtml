<font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">n my May column, I discussed
why the enterprise computing solutions investment cycle was coming to
an end,</font> to be displaced by Web services (<a
href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/erp-end.shtml">Enterprise
Software's End</a>). Unfortunately, a technical description of how Web
services function doesn't explain why we've entered a new evolutionary
stage in how computing will affect organizations.

<P>The idea that computing has evolved over several cyclical stages is
now accepted wisdom. Various authors have discerned a succession of
three-, four- or even eight-stage cycles since 1950, depending on how
they sliced up the written record. Whenever the computer industry
experiences one of its periodic slumps (about every six to eight
years) the gurus, investors and entrepreneurs engage in a guessing
game of what will be the next cycle to spawn yet another bonanza.

<P>Almost everyone agrees that technological innovation is needed to
bring about the next growth cycle. There is also a consensus that the
next wave will have something to do with Web services. However, just
tagging Web services as the engine to create another round of
trillion-dollar investment is a dead end. For the next cycle to
happen, CEOs and CFOs will demand demonstrable gains in added value.

<P>In this environment, anything tagged as a technological improvement
won't sell in the boardrooms. Therefore, market planners and
consultants are repackaging Web services as "customer-centric
computing," "human-centered computing," "ubiquitous computing" and so
forth. This emerging list of hyphenated labels suggests that the
control over IT will migrate closer to the customer. Such reshuffling
will be enormously expensive because it will require junking much of
what's in place right now.

<P>The real story is that the next wave of IT investments will shift
much of the control over IT from the producers of IT (vendors, CIOs,
consultants) to those who can decide what information is worth getting
in order to do their jobs more effectively. When I talk about Web
services, I really mean a practical demand for CIOs to restructure
technology to ease the traumatic shifts from supply-side economics to
demand-side economics.

<P>I'm sure that there will be many debates about whether such a
transformation will actually happen, and if so, how rapidly. Before
making predictions, it's useful to examine how employees will acquire
the capabilities to decide what information to obtain and how much to
pay for it, and those are tough questions.

<P>Moving decision-making about the uses of IT calls for a radical
cultural change. Right now, with the exception of what they fix up on
their PCs, employees are largely force-fed from a menu that has been
cooked by a few decision-makers, mostly technologists. The current
organization of IT is like a 13th century European town, where the
local guilds and the bishop decide what people may wear and
discuss. Introducing a Wal-Mart of choices into such a setting is
likely to upset those who hold power.

<P>But Web services must be seen not just as a technologically
advanced method for managing and distributing information. Internets
and intranets must also be understood as an instant marketplace where
individuals can exercise a wide range of choices about what
information to acquire and how to take advantage of an enormous
variety of information-processing capabilities.

<P>If the exercise of individual choices is the key to the empowerment
of a vastly more productive information workforce, we must set out now
to lay the foundation for a software architecture that will make that
feasible.

<P>After an examination of what is actionable now, I have concluded
that vendor-independent portal technology will be one of the principal
means of making Web services valuable. CIOs should go back to their
architectures and remove vendor-specific ways in which people are
forced to interface with applications.

<P>In their place, CIOs should promote the adoption of generic and
universal portals that can be adapted to employees' scope of work,
skills, literacy and habits.

<P>I see infinite opportunities for the expansion of Web services if
people are offered the opportunity to shape their portals as a
friendly companion for trips into the world of networked knowledge.
