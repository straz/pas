<FONT SIZE="+2">CIOs of the world, beware!</font> The year 2000 legal
manhunt has begun. The traps have been laid, the hinges of litigation
have been oiled and a posse of lawyers is rehearsing how to bag the
catch. Nothing, not even the so-called year 2000 Good Samaritan Act,
can prevent a litigator from transforming a year 2000 incident into
class action, directors' negligence, professional liability, breach of
contract, warranty claims and misrepresentation suits. And believe me,
there are law firms that will rise to the occasion.

<P>
 After years of talking mostly to CIOs, I recently addressed a meeting
of lawyers gathering to discuss year 2000 issues. What a difference
from those cozy, chatty IT conferences! The lawyers' conclave was like
a tank commanders' briefing just prior to an attack. Each presentation
was sharp, with the full text available. The arguments were
documented: no fluff; only facts, footnotes and cases. It's easy to
predict who will prevail. The lawyers have scouted the terrain and
have zeroed in on their targets.

<P>
 Meanwhile, the CIOs are counting &#151; as usual &#151; on emergency
fixes, instant improvisations, tolerance of unfulfilled promises and
budget increases to save their butts.

<P>
 That won't do this time. Look what the lawyers have cooking: 

<P>
<b>Product Liability Claims</b>: Lawyers have started collecting
information, including advertising copy, technical manuals, press
releases and "bug" postings from online bulletin boards to demonstrate
that suppliers had early knowledge of potential year 2000
malfunctions.

<P>
<b>Officers' and Directors' Liability</b>: Legal counsel is now asking when
management first learned that its computer systems could be
noncompliant. If there's a failure, lawyers will argue that every day
that passed was a missed opportunity for directors to perform their
duty. Testimony from former employees and copies of warning memoranda
will be especially damaging under such circumstances.

<P>
<b>Breach of Contract and Warranty Claims</b>: Lawyers realize that year
2000 suits will involve multiple litigants. If A sues B, B will sue C
so that C can recover damages from A. Meanwhile, legal fees are
incurred at each step. It was clear from the meeting that lawyers are
ready for prolonged confrontations.

<P>
<b>Fraud and Misrepresentation</b>: If all else fails, parties will be sued
for falsification of information. Jinxed employees will point fingers
at overoptimistic project schedules and euphoric claims about
reliability &#151; conditions that are chronic in the computing
profession, especially among managers. Lawyers already understand that
this is an exploitable weakness that plays well under
cross-examination of witnesses. Consultants and outsourcing firms will
be particularly vulnerable if they made representations that turn out
to be unsup-portable puffery.

<P>
<b>Insurance Claims</b>: When everything else fails, reach into the pockets
of insurance carriers. The insurance commissioners in most states have
ruled that the carriers can exclude year 2000 coverage. When such an
exclusion is written at policy renewal time, it could imply that it
must have been included to begin with. I listened to an inconclusive
argument between two lawyers about that.

<P>
<b>Incriminating evidence</b>: Class-action lawyers will hire private
investigators (who were present at the conference) to dig up damaging
documents from disgruntled employees and programmers. Often, this will
be done outside the usual discovery process to find new lines of
inquiry to strengthen the plaintiff's case.

<P>
<h3>Management Implications</h3>

Blaming programmers for the year 2000 glitch won't stand up in court.
The omission of two digits has never been purely a coding problem or a
cost-saving measure. Making trade-offs among profits, investments,
operating priorities and quality requires the full engagement of top
management &#151; in particular the CIOs.

<P>
 But I don't see any indication that computer people are ready to
explain how and why the year 2000 problem happened and how similar
problems can be avoided in the future. In fact, the computer folks
don't yet understand the legal traps that will snare them or realize
that the year 2000 lawsuits will bring in their wake far closer
executive oversight of the IT function than we've known to date.

<P>
 CIOs will learn the simple truth that who pays and who goes to jail
are what legal disputes are all about. Everyone should understand that
corporate officers and directors will surely not wish to assume any
blame as year 2000 defendants.

<P>
 What an irony! Of all people, it will be the lawyers who finally
teach the IT profession how to provide quality software. They will be
paid well for teaching what could have been mastered much less
expensively years ago.

served as a computer executive for more than 30 years and was able to
avoid litigation for that entire period. He doubts if any 21st century
CIO will be able to make that claim. </font><p>
