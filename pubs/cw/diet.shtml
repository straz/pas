<font size="+2">O</font><font size="+1">ne of consultants' and academics' favorite assumptions
about the effects of computers is that they help reduce the size of corporate
assets.</font>  Computer applications, they claim, reduce inventories,
accelerate revenue collection, promote better capacity utilization,
increase the reliability of just-in-time ordering of parts and speed
up work in process. If you sift through all of the claims that were
made by proponents of &quot;enterprise systems,&quot; most of the
measurable benefits were always attributed to a dramatic decline in
the value of corporate assets rather than reductions in labor
costs.<p>

Ever since the infatuation with enterprise systems fizzled because of
excessive costs, those same promises were transplanted to various
forms of interenterprise systems, such as the highly touted
expectations of benefits from e-commerce.<p>

I've always been bothered by the persistence of the myth that
computers are a surefire wonder diet to slim down corporate assets.
But I had no way of independently verifying this claim. Anecdotal
descriptions in computer magazines didn't help because they never
delivered hard numbers, nor did they document what actually
happened.<p>

The latest compilation of more than 25,000 annual reports of every
major, listed corporation in the world led me to study their latest
financial data and share my findings with readers. My approach: Focus
on the trends in the deployment of corporate assets during most of the
past two decades, when companies were installing computers at a rapid
rate. Corporations were placing the largest bets on the prospective
payoffs from computers. When corporations invested in IT, asset
reduction always led the parade of prospective tangible gains. <p>

Here's evidence of what nearly two decades of exuberant spending has delivered.<p>

I compared the amounts of <b>total corporate assets</b> needed to
support each dollar of <b>corporate revenue</b>. If the hypothesis of
computerization as an asset-saver were to hold up, then the percentage
of <b>total assets to total revenue</b> would decline. Consistent
historical data for assets and revenues was available for 1,848
randomly chosen U.S. corporations with total assets in 1999 of $16.6
trillion and total revenues of $7.4 trillion. This sample represents
most of the total corporate assets.<p>

The steady gain in the percentage of assets necessary to support
revenues caused U.S. firms to require an additional $7.1 trillion in
assets in 1999, 75% more than what worked for them in 1982.<p>

To check whether the U.S. experience was unique, I also examined
similar numbers for the U.K. and the Netherlands, which are noted for
their good experiences in applying IT. But even in those countries,
there has been a steady increase in the assets required to support
each dollar in revenue.<p>

<b>Implications:</b> The past two decades saw the installation of
increasingly complex and costly information management systems that
promised reductions in most asset accounts. After examining the data
in audited financial statements, I can only conclude that the expected
contributions of computers can't be verified in the numbers.<p>

The percentage of total assets to total revenue is a most telling
indicator that will help CIOs validate the effectiveness of their IT
projects. Given the increased pressure on CIOs in today's slowing
economy to justify and then track the payoffs from IT investments,
this metric will offer highly credible proof of superior performance
because it can be linked directly to financial statements. From now
on, what counts is what benefits shareholders. The prescription for
that: Create a trim organization that can compete with fewer assets to
support rising revenue.<p>
