<font size="+2">N</font><font size="+1">one of my Computerworld
columns has generated as many comments</font> as the <a
href="paradoxrevisited.shtml">Sept. 6 analysis</a> of the computer
paradox. Readers were troubled by the absence of any correlation
between IT spending and corporate profits, which is perhaps the most
accurate way of defining and measuring the paradox.<p>


The letters noted that rapidly falling prices of desktop computers, as
well as the explosion in Internet use, were self-evident proofs of
productivity gains from computerization. The fact that none of these
developments has so far shown up favorably in corporate financial data
didn't seem to discourage anyone.<p>

A leading IT magazine has come up with a novel response to the
computer paradox. It has suggested that IT-based innovation is the
source for creating new business value. The magazine ranked 500 U.S.
corporations according to their innovative capabilities. Corporations
engaging in e-business, enterprise resource planning, data mining,
enterprise portals or similar buzzword-compliant activities received
gold, silver or bronze "medals." Four gold medals put a company in the
top rankings. <p>

I could argue over the process by which individual firms were awarded
their ranks, because the findings reflected the unverifiable opinions
of the IT people who were surveyed.<p>

But I won't, because we need not depend only on surveys to assess
business value. Audited financial reports offer more reliable
indicators. When IT executives spend money, they are acting on behalf
of the firm's shareholders. Therefore, the most appropriate metric for
judging business value from computer-based innovations would relate
them to net profits, operating profits and return on shareholders'
equity.<p>

To verify the trustworthiness of the magazine's innovation rankings, I
devised a way to compare top- and bottom-ranked corporations. The
question was whether a company awarded four gold medals would deliver
greater business value than one with four bronze medals.<p>

Because only 450 of the magazine-ranked firms published their complete financial results, I chose the top 45 ranked firms (such as Marshall Industries, Microsoft and Sprint) and compared their average financial performance with the bottom 45 (such as American Greetings, Tidewater and Textron).<p>

How well did the innovation rankings compare with the financial
measures of value creation? They didn't hold up:<p>

<ul>
<li>1998 operating income growth over 1997: The bottom 45 outgrew the top 45, 18.3% to 15.4%.<p>

<li>Five-year average net income growth: The bottom 45, 14.8% to 14.3% for the top.<p>

<li>Five-year average net equity growth: Again, the bottom 45 outgrew the top 45, 18.5% to 16.2%.<p>

<li>Five-year average employee growth: The top 45 finished ahead, 10.2% to 8.5%.</ul><p>

So, the bottom-ranked 45 firms showed better results than the top 45
in three of the categories that measure financial performance. There
were other interesting indicators, but I included only the five-year
employment growth comparisons. When it came to hiring, the top
"innovators" exceeded the growth rates of the bottom-ranked firms. The
innovators grew faster in personnel but not in business value.<p>

It's often argued that the benefits of innovations show up only in the
long run. That may be true about many start-ups, but the rankings
discussed here cover only well-established firms whose shareholder
values depend on historical as well as current financial
performance.<p>

Where I've served as CIO, I've always favored innovation. But the
current frenzy to adopt new computerized practices without examining
the cash benefits can be damaging, especially if a leading publication
blesses such a point of view. As in any arms race, the speed and
expense for adopting computerized solutions must be tempered by sober
economic analysis. For a business to survive, it must be steadily
profitable and increase shareholder value at rates superior to those
of its competitors. Magazine surveys that rely on surveying opinions
about technological excellence aren't credible if the financial
results don't support such claims.<p>
