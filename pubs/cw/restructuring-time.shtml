<h2>Era of Expansion Ends: Time for Restructuring</h2>

<font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">e are at the end of an era</font>
in which the objective for IT managers was to acquire as many IT
resources as possible. From now on, we'll have to squeeze as much
value out of IT budgets as rapid restructuring will allow.

<P>In the past 20 years, CIOs have thrived on expansion. Future CIOs
will have to cope with meager dollar growth. They'll survive by
rethinking how they spend the money in their budgets. The current
allocations to hardware, software and services will have to shift
because asking for substantial additional funds will be
unacceptable. CIOs will have to be frugal about how they spend money
and allocate the spending differently.

<P>From 1980 to 2001, the typical IT budget grew 10% to 15% per
year. The performance of IT also kept improving by at least 15%. It's
no wonder that the dominant characteristic of the past 20 years was
waste. You can't extract gains in productivity if IT insists on
acquiring at a gluttonous rate.

<P>Why were organizations unable to digest the IT capabilities? The
explanation is simple. Each firm had to organize its IT department,
train managers, educate executives, develop most of its software and
integrate vendor offerings with disorderly legacy code. It was easier
to junk and rebuild than to accumulate and grow. Vendors and
consultants thrived, with revenues growing faster than IT
budgets. Vendors and consultants reaped about 30% of total worldwide
IT spending of $2 trillion in 2001.

<P>The vendors and consultants prospered by selling goods without
warranties and avoiding performance liabilities. The customer took all
of the risks. If the technology didn't perform, customers had to buy
the next upgrade or spend money fixing the mess.

<P>This worked well for the vendors and consultants because foul-ups
generated more revenues. It was also good for CIOs. They could justify
bigger staffs and larger budgets to keep the IT machinery going. What
we got was a technology contest, not a demonstrable economic gain.

<P>But it's the 70% of IT spending that goes to internal corporate
expenditures rather than vendors and consultants that's now the source
of the greatest opportunity for improvement. Risks for IT management
should migrate from customers to the vendors. Right now, customers
must cope with technology obsolescence.

<p>That's a misplaced expense. The costs of excessive technology
depreciation should be absorbed by vendors that often aim for
increased obsolescence. Instead of buying software and then spending a
huge multiple of the cost for integrating, fixing, maintaining and
modernizing the technology, let the vendors deliver guaranteed
application service. Start throttling back on software licenses
(currently up to 25% of the total IT budget), on consultants and on
the internal staff of maintenance programmers to keep systems from
falling apart.

<P>Instead, reassign most of your maintenance staff -- about 20% of
your budget -- to value-enhancing improvements. Get the IT staffers
out of the IT department and give them careers in business
operations. Eliminate contract labor -- another 10% to 15% of the
budget. Your services vendors will have to assure systems integration
as they deliver solutions. You'll rent application services and not
spend time on IT housekeeping. In this way you can dispense with much
of the overhead and concentrate on creating business value.

<P>The next big opportunity is to cut the costs of your computing
infrastructure. Even the largest organizations don't have a sufficient
volume of work to justify the reliable, secure, redundant and flexible
processing and networking capacity they currently support. In the
compulsion for control, organizations still keep acquiring too many
underutilized technology assets. 

<p>The worst examples of such excesses are the 200 million desktop
computers in offices throughout the U.S. Each has a full cost of well
over $3,000 per year. If you examine the prices for vendors supporting
desktops as a Web service, you can come to only one conclusion: It's
only a matter of time before much of the standard computing and
messaging infrastructure will benefit from such services at enormous
savings.

<P>IT is neither irrelevant, mature nor at a point of diminishing
returns, despite such contentions in a May <I>Harvard Business
Review</I> article <A HREF="http://www.computerworld.com/q?a3330">(see
story)</A>. It suffers primarily from mismanagement. The time has now
come to cure that so we can get moving again.

anticipates that IT will again become one of the enablers of economic growth.
