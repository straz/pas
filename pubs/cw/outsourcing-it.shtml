<p><font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">nformation technology experts find it convenient to discuss the
advances of computing in terms of technology "generations." There is a
generally acknowledged evolution from the mainframe to the
minicomputer, microcomputer, client/server and Internet stages of
development. Yet defining IT strictly in terms of electronics doesn't
necessarily offer an insight into economic gains.</P>

<P>Technology, in isolation, doesn't give us an understanding of the
ideas that have propelled the progression from one stage of
development to the next stage. For that, you need to consider the
ideas of the 1991 Nobel Prize economist Ronald Coase, which are likely
to guide the formulation of IT investments in the future.</P>

<P>The management of IT has always been steered by assumptions about
economics. Grosch's Law, formulated by Herbert Grosch in 1953, stated
that the power of computers grew as a square function of their
costs. For almost 20 years, that simple conjecture (ultimately proven
to be incorrect) dictated investments in corporate computing. Whenever
possible, you upgraded to the largest mainframe computer you could
afford. It was this compulsion that drove IBM to increase its
manufacturing capacity for bigger mainframes until this strategy
reached its economic limits and drove the company to the brink of
bankruptcy.</P>

<P>Of all the computing "laws," I consider only Moore's Law to be
based on verifiable evidence. It stated that the power of
microprocessors would double every 18 months without corresponding
increases in costs. The explosive proliferation of desktop (and
laptop) computing propelled the practice of corporate IT for 20 years
until it reached its current conditions, where the total costs of
ownership have reached economic limits and the growth rate has leveled
off, thus driving most suppliers out of business.</P>

<P>Robert Metcalfe's and George Gilder's formulations extended Moore's
Law into the realm of communications. They stated that the value of
interconnectivity would grow as a square of the number of connected
devices, while the available bandwidth would expand much faster than
the capacity of computing.</P>

<P>The multitrillion-dollar collapse of the technology bubble can be
best explained as an unwarranted extrapolation of these concepts
beyond any sustainable economic limits. Followers of Metcalfe's and
Gilder's conjectures have induced the economic collapse of many
communications companies. They bet shareholders' money on business
that didn't materialize.</P>

<P>The problem with the Grosch, Moore, Metcalfe and Gilder
formulations was that they concentrated only on the supply side of IT
and paid little attention to the demand side. Those men were IT
insiders who became wealthy from the rising prosperity for which they
acted as prophets.</P>

<P>This is where a modestly compensated academic, Coase, comes in. He
is the first economist of any consequence who has anything useful to
say about information economics.</P>

<P>Coase studied why organizations are formed, what guides their
growth and what leads to their demise. He observed that companies will
expand until "the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the
firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on
the open market." That is now known as Coase's Law. It represents an
Information Age reformulation of the law of diminishing returns, which
applied only to capital assets.</P>

<P>As organizations grow, they become complicated and find it costly
to coordinate what they do. Coase observed that there are always
companies that can deliver goods and services more economically than
the dominant enterprises. If the more efficient companies become
organized, they'll squeeze out those that have been unable to manage
their resources. The only recourse for the inefficient companies is to
shift inefficient functions to external suppliers. Thus, a carmaker
will buy batteries from a supplier rather than manufacture them
in-house if that's more cost-effective.</P>

<P>IT executives will have to accept that Coase's Law argues for
outsourcing every IT function that can be delivered more efficiently
by others. Corporate executives will demand that CIOs demonstrate how
each element of their in-house IT spending has a lower cost than
what's available in the marketplace. Farming out some of the labor to
countries whose wages are a fraction of compensation in the U.S. is a
relatively easy decision. The tough questions will concern whether to
outsource a part or all of the company's computing infrastructure.</P>

<P>CIOs will have to justify contracting for the management of
desktops, laptops or cell phones and having contractors provide
security assurance, and they'll have to show that a commercially
available standard application service can substitute for the legacy
systems that have become unmanageable.</P>

<P>Acceptance of Coase's Law will force CIOs to prove that the total
cost of retaining an extra transaction within the IT budget will be
less than asking the competitive market to deliver it by means of
network connectivity. It will convert every company from an
organization-centric environment to a multisupplier services
environment. This new focus will set the agenda for IT management for
years to come. </P>
