Twenty years of experience as a CIO trying to explain budget increases to
corporate executives has taught me that our traditional means of evaluating
productivity don't work. In this issue, you'll find criteria that do.<p>
This year's listing of <i>Computerworld Premier 100 </i>companies was compiled
based on my own Information Productivity<font size="-2">(tm)</font> Index.<p>
Information Productivity<font size="-2">(tm)</font> measures and rewards the effectiveness of corporate
management. It does not reward the more common metrics of information
technology spending, such as computer budget, the value of installed equipment
or other measures of brute force. That is because there is no demonstrable
correlation between the financial performance of a firm and the amount it
spends on information technologies. What matters is not how much you spend but
how well you spend it in supporting business missions and contributing to
productivity.<p>
The old justification methods don't work because they rely on ratios that
measure the efficiency of capital. These indicators have such names as return
on assets, return on investment and return on equity. But in modern
enterprises, capital doesn't mean as much as it used to. The performance of
high technology and service businesses are influenced more by the quality of
their management than by their assets.<p>
Productivity is the ratio of output to input. Unfortunately, there's no place
for management's output on an income statement. But there is a way to calculate
it. If you subtract from after-tax profits the value of the shareholder's equity 
capital, what's left is the value of management.<p>
Technology isn't productive in itself. But well-managed,
superbly trained and motivated people -- with or without computers -- can show
measurable gains in output.<p>
Input of management is the cost of the coordination of an enterprise,
frequently defined as either overhead or indirect costs.<p>
These definitions of output and input reject conventional productivity
measures. For example, revenue is not a measure of output because it includes
value added by suppliers. Profits are not an acceptable measure of performance
because they don't include compensation to shareholders. Costs--especially
costs per employee--are misleading indicators of input because they include the
value of purchases. The value of assets is irrelevant as a measure of input
because leasing and outsourcing distort that statistic.<p>
Recent improvements in financial reporting and the availability of detailed
financial information have made it possible to calculate a reasonable return on
management. For output, I use Stern, Stewart &amp; Co.'s popular Economic Value-Added
(EVA). If EVA is not available, output can be calculated by subtracting from
operating profit after taxes the value of shareholder equity, multiplied by the
cost of capital.<p>
The costs of sales, general and administration (SG&amp;A) are a reasonable
approximation of management costs. Divide EVA by SG&amp;A to get the
Information Productivity<font size="-2">(tm)</font> Index.<p>
The <i>Computerworld Premier 100 </i>rankings have been calculated using
published 1993 financial results for the Fortune 1000. Because some firms show
wide swings in year-to-year profits, our rankings also considered three-year
averages. Firms that reported favorable operating profits after taxes but also
large accounting write-offs,
which made their shareholder equity negative, were eliminated from
consideration.<p>
Because Information Productivity<font size="-2">(tm)</font> relates to the numbers that are watched and
understood by your board of directors, your top executives and your
shareholders, this year's <i>Computerworld Premier 100</i> rankings offer a
sound basis from which to start discussions on how to do better next year.
