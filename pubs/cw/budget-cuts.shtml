<h3>Tough Budget Sessions Loom Ahead.</h3>

Computer budgets tend to rise above long-term budget averages when
profits increase, and they dip if profits decrease. With credible
predictions of a downturn in 1998 profits beginning to emerge, CIOs
should brace themselves for tough times.<p>

I pay attention to the economic forecasts issued by the investment
banking firm of Morgan Stanley, one of the foremost financiers of U.S.
computer firms.<p>

In a March 21 research report titled "PC Saturation?" chief economist
Stephen Roach writes that next year's profits for U.S. corporations are
expected to decrease by 2.5%.<p>

That's the first time in eight years that we can expect a broad decline
in profits. It follows a long period of prosperity when profit growth
averaged more than 3% per year. Mounting competitive pressures from
excess global capacity will keep prices down, and increased productivity
wont compensate for inflation. <p>

Furthermore, Roach says he expects the U.S. Gross Domestic Product
growth to decline from 3.1% this year to only 1.9% next year. Roach
concluded that, therefore, a period of stagnation in information
technology spending is likely.<p>

<h3>The Stock Market as a Predictor</h3>

The Morningstar organization, the foremost compiler of statistics about
mutual fund performance, has just updated its quarterly indicators about
gains by all domestic stocks and U.S. IT stocks. I compared these
patterns and found an amazing correlation: When the stock market
increases even slightly, the technology stocks shoot up. When the stock
market dips even slightly, the technology stocks take a dive. <p>

For instance, when the market was up early in 1995 by 2%, IT stocks
gained 13%. In the first quarter of this year, the market fell 2% and
technology stocks plunged 13%. Investors seem to understand that
whenever business suffers, computer budgets get squeezed.<p>

<h3>IT Budget Implications</h3>

The good times are coming to an end, and it couldn't come at a worse
time.<p>

By and large, CIOs are accustomed to easy IT budget reviews and ample
increases in funding. After all, most of them took their positions after
the recession that ended in 1992.<p>

In the past three years, IT budgets have become encumbered with all
sorts of ambitious ventures that depend on a steady increase in
available dollars. It's unlikely that CIOs have put together contingency
plans for when the budget crunch suddenly sets in.<p>

CIOs will undoubtedly argue that a company can't afford to cut current
operations and projects, such as year 2000 fixes, information security
programs and highly visible programs.<p>

That means 1998 budget reviews will start with all IT resources already
oversubscribed. If austerity sets in, there may not be much funding
available for new initiatives.<p>

Later this year, everyone should prepare to see many projects canceled.
Resumes may start circulating again, as happened during each of the five
cyclical turns during the last 40 years of computerization.<p>

<h3>Preparing for a Downturn</h3>

Many companies will seek easy solutions to the problem: Outsource the
whole problem to someone who will promise a 20% cost reduction, or
reshuffle the organization and bring in a new team that promises to
somehow meet the new budget targets.<p>

Stretching out schedules and postponing innovation will be by far the
most frequent compromise in the negotiations for funds. That may be
workable, but it will hurt IS's reputation to deliver on their
promises.<p>

My advice is to face budget adversity with an aggressive cost-reduction
program.<p>

The typical $200 million major corporate IT budget includes at least $40
million to maintain existing computer applications. Maintenance received
very little attention in every organization I examined. With technology
costs dropping at well over 20% per year, there's no reason why a smart
CIO couldn't come prepared to fund development in a no-increase 1988
budget through savings on operations.<p>

If IS management wishes to sustain its commitments while the IT budget
remains level or declines, the best way to do so is to uncover savings
in IS operations.<p> It's May, and there is still time to prepare a
prudent cost-reduction plan, just in case that may be necessary.<p>
