<h2>E-mail is Only One Path to Success</h2>
<b>by Paul A. Strassmann<br><br>
Computerworld</b><br>
January 9, 1995, p.35<hr>

If you believe what you read, there are anywhere from 5 million to 22 million
people pecking away on keyboards and passing messages back and forth. According
to the pundits, we are witnessing a change in habits not seen since the
abandonment of the horse for the automobile.<p>
<p>
Yet nobody knows the extent to which Email is used to perform useful business
tasks. To make a judgment about the importance of E-mail to business we must
get reasonably good facts. Luckily, the editors of <i>Computerworld </i>posed
questions about E-mail
to the candidates for the 1994 <i>Premier 100</i> list of the most effective
users of information technology [CW, Sept. 19, 1994].<p>
<p>
Only 40% of the employees of the Premier 100 firms have computers, and only a
fraction of those are connected to a network. Of those connected, 75.5% have E-mail
available for internal communications. The combination of these factors gives
you the revelation that only 18% of the employees at Premier 100 firms have
E-mail on their computers. That statistic still does not reveal how many
actually use it, but it tells you that even highly productive organizations
have enormous potential for exploring E-mail as a communications means.<p>
<p>
Proponents of the information superhighway do not pay much attention to
internal communications because they are more interested in inter company
electronic sharing of information. It just so happens that the Premier 100
survey also included the question "How many desktops/laptops have access to
customers or suppliers?" The answer was a disappointing median of 5%, which
accounts for little electronic commerce.<p>
<p>
In addition, I have found no correlation whatsoever between the extent of E-mail
availability and the information productivity of firms, as measured by the
ratio of economic value-added/estimated
total cost of information. As a matter of fact, three of the Top 10 most
productive firms in the Premier 100 hardly use E-mail;
five of the 10 most productive firms have E-mail
installed on PCs operated by more than 90% of their employees. That may be tied
to the tendency of smaller firms to rely less on E-mail
because everybody meets for coffee to swap all the news that matters.<p>
<p>
The median Premier 100 company has $2.6 billion in sales, employs 10,224 people
and has 3,880 desktop or laptop computers: It is slightly larger than the
median for all Fortune 1,000 corporations. This means we have a representative
sample of the characteristics of U.S. corporations that use not only E-mail,
but also mainframes and microcomputers, and their software expenditures. I ran
a test to see if the larger companies rely on E-mail
communications more than<b> </b>the smaller ones. To my surprise, they didn't.
Plotting employment against E-mail
use revealed no pattern favoring companies with large numbers of employees. The
only variable that correlated was mainframe usage: Companies providing remote
access to databases also make extensive use of E-mail.<p>
<p>
What are the implications of this? First, do not switch to E-mail with the
expectation that the information productivity of your firm will automatically
increase. Second, before you commit to the currently fashionable superhighway
of electronic commerce campaigns, make sure you fully understand what the
specific effect s on your company's measurable productivity performance will
be. Third, view E-mail
as part of a much larger package of how your people share information, rather
than as an isolated application.
