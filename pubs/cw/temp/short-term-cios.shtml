<font size="+2">B</font><font size="+1"> ack in the June 10, 1996,
issue of <i>Computerworld</i>, I first reported on the average
longevity of CIOs in their jobs.</font> Based on comparisons between 1994 and
1995, I calculated the one-year turnover rate for CIOs to be 24%,
which translated into an average job-tenure expectancy of 25 to 28
months this ( that
<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/jobholding.shtml">
see story
</a>).

<P>Those estimates were widely quoted in many articles by authors who
arrived at various conclusions about the significance of my
numbers. One author believed that the rapid turnover rate offered
telling evidence that future CEOs were groomed for advancement by
passing through a brief tour of duty in the CIO position. Others saw
it as proof of the persistent failure by top management to understand
the performance requirements for the CIO job. Frequent swapping of
people in and out of the CIO position was seen elsewhere as an example
of managerial confusion about the rising importance of information
economics.

<P>To my best knowledge, there have been no published studies of CIO
turnover in the eight years since. The time seems ripe to check
whether the CIO position has acquired greater permanence as IT budgets
have more than doubled.

<P>In press reports, 244 companies identified the names of their CIOs
both in 2002 and in 2003. Fifty-one CIO names were different from one
year to another, offering an individually verified one-year attrition
rate of 21%. However, the press also mentioned 111 CIOs in 2002 who
didn't reappear in 2003. There were also 100 CIOs listed in 2003 who
escaped press attention in 2002. If we assume -- and from my
experience, it's a safe assumption -- that about half of these
unidentified CIOs left their jobs in the interim, the one-year
attrition rate climbs to 34%.

<P>The best way to interpret the attrition numbers is to calculate the
time it takes until only half of the original CIOs remain in their
positions. Using the 21% attrition rate, there will be only 79 CIOs
left out of 100 after a 12-month interval. After 24 months, there will
be only 62 left. Half of the CIOs will thus be gone in 35
months. Using the 34% estimated attrition rate, there would be only 66
CIOs left after 12 months. Half of the CIOs would be gone after 21
months.

<P><!--beginpage2-->There is no way of telling whether the half-life
of the estimated CIO population of well over 2,000 is 20 or 35
months. Based on the only data available to the public, one can assume
that the number is somewhere between the two time periods and not much
different from what it was in 1994/1995. I take this view because the
sources of my information -- the IT press -- favor stories about CIO
winners and therefore offers a positively biased view about CIOs who
may be enjoying management's favors. Such a bias would tend to shift
the actual life expectancy closer to the most conservative estimate of
21 months because the CIO loser would never get the attention from the
press, whether he was coming or going.

<P>I find these observations worrisome, in the same way that I did in
1996. The CIO's role is to guide the development, preservation,
security and enhancement of a company's information assets. Such
assets now exceed in value the financial assets that are guarded by
the CFO establishment, which must comply with a long list of
precedents, regulations and public scrutiny.

<P>The only way to compensate for the absence of such consistency in
policy and precedent is to put in place leadership in the person of
the CIO, who will steer a steady course and be able to provide the
necessary guidance for the IT organization. A leader can accomplish
that only by taking a long-term view. Holding a job for only a brief
time is inconsistent with committing to and then making progress
against lasting objectives.

<P>CIOs are likely to view the high turnover rates as incentives to
make choices that will look good on their next resume. Short-term
executives will assume that they won't be around when the time comes
to account for a perfectly predictable foul-up. Thus, the short time
on a job becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for avoiding responsible
leadership. High CIO turnover is one of the telling symptoms of the
malaise that makes our IT less effective than its potential.
