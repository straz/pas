<h2>Ensuring Privacy Protection for All</h2>

You cannot manage information systems without recognizing that much of the
information workforce has a deep emotional attachment to their PCs. If you
tamper with this relationship, you will be attacked with the fury of a
homeowner defending his own property.<p>
The PC allows office workers to work for their own benefit. Frequent activities
include composition of resumes, correspondence to enhance one's public image,
self education to acquire new marketable skills and production of memoranda to
prove arguments.<p>
It is important to note that there was no privacy protection for on-line
files such as resumes under the old regime, in which a central computer
recorded every keystroke. In the PC era, protecting and preserving the privacy
of computer files is one of the most painful issues any information executive
must address. If you neglect it, someday it will come back to bite you or your
successors with potentially enormous costs for getting your digital archives
reorganized.<p>
Personal privacy dictates the imposition of tight technical rules on how to
enter, retrieve and store information. Some organizations in which security has
always been a prime concern already have such rules. A physically separate
erasable device or a partition of memory dedicated to an individual on a server
should be the only place where an individual can store private data. Only the
individual should initiate the copying of private data. A person's private
memory should be password protected and possibly encrypted, and the individual
should erase all such information when leaving employment.<p>
If you don't have such policies regarding personal use of company computer
resources, people can and will assume they have what lawyers call an implied
right to use the systems and the information on those systems as they see
fit.<p>
There must be a line beyond which individuals should be able to manage their
allocation of computer capacity for personal use. Such freedom carries the
accountability for not abusing such privileges. For example, individuals should
pay out of pocket for strictly personal software--games, mailing lists and
checkbook managers. With most of that software, copies are passed around among
casual friends. Corporate policies must make clear that copyright infringement
liability for such uses should be the individual's and not the
corporation's.<p>
In addition, while the corporation must recognize the need for the individual's
privacy, the individual has to consent to the organization's security
standards. One way is to require that each time the person logs on to the
computer he sees text defining the conditions of his access, and continuing the
log-on process signifies his agreement with those conditions.<p>
What should you do if you don't have such policies protecting both the
individual's privacy and the corporation's security? Until legal doctrine and
systems management policies catch up with the reality of personal computing,
the only defense you have is to just say no and help people buy their own
PCs.
