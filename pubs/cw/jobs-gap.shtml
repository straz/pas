<font size="+2">M</font><font size="+1">eta Group researchers say</font>
there are 400,000 unfilled IT jobs in the U.S., and that figure is
expected to balloon to 1 million by 2003. Should your long-range IT
plans include the added costs of paying spiraling salaries to fill
these jobs?

<P>Only if you want to run afoul of your senior executives. 

<P>Whenever there's a shortage of personnel, wages rise, turnover
increases and quality declines as companies hire less-qualified
applicants. Every economic indicator confirms that this is happening
today. IT staffs are being paid higher salaries than their business
counterparts with equivalent educational and career backgrounds.
Nearly 70% of the organizations surveyed by Meta Group say they pay
their IT staffs more than what they pay end users.

<P>
 Scarcities, whether in oil, steel, food supplies, switchboard
operators or engineers, have never lasted too long. All forecasts that
have extrapolated shortages into projections of chronic scarcities
have always been proved wrong. This is particularly true when a sudden
shortfall is caused by a combination of a cutback in supplies and a
squandering of resources. The recent jumps in the prices of gasoline
and heating oil are good examples of this phenomenon. Recent
scarcities of plywood, orange juice, gold, wallboard and the metal
palladium have shown similar patterns, but these shortages will be
reversed as soon as higher prices bring supply and demand back into
balance.

<P>
 Current anxieties about the approach of an extreme IT labor shortage
are ripe for such a reversal. Corporate executives are preparing to
insist on fewer labor-intensive solutions to their software needs.
Rising wages, increased turnover and declining quality won't be
tolerated as the IT budgets keep creeping up to approach the size of
corporate profits. While the employable U.S. workforce is growing at
the annual pace of only 1.5%, adding another million positions to an
IT workforce that's already expanding at a torrid rate of 15% is no
way to improve the productivity of the computer people.

<P>
 Enter the application service providers. As soon as ASPs can deliver
reliable user support over networks, organizations will find that
renting complete business solutions instead of constructing and
maintaining their own home-cooked spaghetti code is an increasingly
attractive alternative. There are already ASPs that can satisfy
cross-functional systems needs, such as in enterprisewide resource
management in specialized market segments like automobile assembly,
wholesale drugs and electronic merchandising.

<P>
 The idea that each organization must design its own computing
infrastructure, master the adoption of technological innovations and
maintain all software enhancements is obsolete. It's as medieval a
concept as the dependency of each 12th century European town on its
merchant, shoemaking, furniture manufacturing and ironworking guilds.
These labor-intensive and immensely costly institutions lost their
economic viability as soon as national and -- ultimately -- global
trading organizations were able to deploy capital over a wider
geographical base than was made possible by those who relied only on
local economies.

<P>
 Many IT executives  will be sitting down this spring  to  draft their
long-range plans. If they propose large salary increases to compensate
for the  prospect  of a  gruesome labor shortage,  business executives
will demand alternative solutions.

<P>
 Business as usual, or even swapping company heads for offshore
consultants, won't solve the problem. Instead, plan to phase out the
wasteful insistence on IT self-sufficiency -- what I call the medieval
guild phase of systems construction. Prepare to rent systems services
from huge services corporations to spread the costs of an increasingly
expensive and risky systems infrastructure that only giant integrated
firms will be able to afford. This is why all the hand-wringing about
the coming shortage of IT personnel should be seen as nothing but a
self-serving prophecy by consultants who thrive on scare tactics that
would increase the demand for their premium-priced services.
<P>

correct imbalances between available means and emerging new business
