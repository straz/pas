<font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">n July, the General Accounting
Office published what I consider a rare insight into IT
spending.</font> The agency broke down the $26 billion Department of
Defense IT budget into the following categories: business systems,
$5.2 billion; business infrastructure, $12.8 billion; mission support
(including its own separate infrastructure), $8 billion. </P>

<P>Less than half of the total cost is accounted for by the share of
spending that directly and visibly supports users. The lion's share
goes toward the "infrastructure" -- the hole from whence bugs,
disruptions and mysterious failures come. </P>

<P>Here we have an audit confirming what I have seen creeping up on IT
for more than 20 years: It isn't the applications but the need to
support a costly infrastructure that has been dampening the funding
for technological innovation. </P>

<P>You can always get votes for adding another attractive
application. But hardly anybody will sign up to support an
infrastructure that may be serving customers who aren't paying their
way. Selling tickets for seats in fancy rail cars was always
easy. Finding money to pay for the track, switches, signal equipment
and the fuel depot was always much harder.</P>

<P>The root cause of IT failures and excessive IT costs in large
organizations lies in rickety infrastructures put in place one project
at a time. What you usually have in large organizations is not a
secure, low-cost and reliable infrastructure but a patchwork of
connections cobbled together without sufficient funding and rushed to
completion without sufficient safeguards.</P>

<P>The currently fashionable approach is to impose centrally dictated
"architectures" to cure the pains from incompatible and redundant
systems. Such architectures are just another way of achieving order
through centralization and consolidation. Unfortunately, under rapidly
changing conditions, such a cure may be worse than the original
disease.</P>

<P>Invariably, centralization involves the awarding of a huge
outsourcing contract to a vendor for whom a critical piece of the
infrastructure is carved out, such as the management of
desktops. Associated servers, switches and data centers may also be
included in the IT territory ceded to the outsourcer, while the
resident IT bureaucracy always keeps tight control of a few fatally
critical components in order to retain its absolute power. </P>

<P>This approach to fixing infrastructure deficiencies is flawed
because the sequence for fixing a broken setup is
backward. Contracting for an infrastructure should be the last -- not
the first -- step in putting improved systems in place. </P>

<P>First, IT managers should focus on determining which applications
must be delivered immediately. The reliability, affordability and
timing of application services will dictate which one of the many
conceivable infrastructures would work best to solve high-priority
problems.</P>

<P>Second, the organization's management structure and business goals
must be set. I don't see how one can get funding for overhauling
infrastructure as a separate investment. As a credible business case,
such investments offer notoriously sterile ground. Infrastructures
must be designed so that each step can be financed with incremental
funding. Such economics make outsourcing of infrastructure services to
a computing "utility" the preferred solution. The recent huge wins by
a computer services firm offering "on-demand" usage pricing is a good
sign that customers are ready to buy computing "by the quart" instead
of owning a farm.</P>

<P>Third, a feasible transition plan for legacy applications must be
developed and tested prior to making the least risky technical
choices. </P>

<P>Only after the completion of this sequence would it be safe to
proceed with outsourcing. Precipitous contracting for infrastructure
services is only for the hasty and the impatient (who will be long
gone when the auditors finally show up). </P>

<P><i><b>Paul A. Strassmann</b> (<A
HREF="mailto:paul@strassmann.com">paul@strassmann.com</A>) has
concluded that the best way of presenting a business case for IT
investments is to make it a discretionary variable expense.</i>
