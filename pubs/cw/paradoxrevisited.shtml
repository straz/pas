<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">here are fabulously profitable
firms</font> with low per-capita spending on computerization.  Likewise,
there are dismally unprofitable firms with high per-capita spending on
computerization. Why? Since 1985, I have published <a
href="http://www.infoeconomics.com">five books</a> dealing with the "computer
paradox," which states that there is no evidence that greater spending
on computers will necessarily boost a firm's productivity. With one
exception, nobody has quarreled with the data itself.<p>

Nevertheless, the critics found it difficult to swallow the
observations that the paradox persists. Their experiences told them
otherwise. Computers were wonderful, and most of us couldn't function
without them.

<p>Recently, I received a message from one of the most respected
computer scientists, now a retired CEO who frequently speaks at
industry events. He wrote, "I refuse to believe that my former
customers and my current audiences are fools and idiots. I wonder if
IT investments correlate with something other than profits -- or
something you are missing."

<p>I don't believe that I am missing any facts. Since 1982, I have
tried to find correlations with IT spending, including every
conceivable variable such as revenue, assets, stock market prices and
shareholder equity. So far, I can't report success, and nobody else
(to my best knowledge) has found a positive relationship. Thus, the
paradox remains a phenomenon, though it is also true that computers
enable people to work faster, smarter and in ways that were never
feasible before.

<p>After looking at all the evidence, I have concluded that the
computer paradox is here to stay. The best we can do is understand
why.

<p>The root cause of the computer paradox lies in the uses of
computerization as the weapon of choice in economic competition. The
costs and effectiveness of information management, not the possession
of physical capital, have become decisive in separating the winners
from the losers. In these contests, everyone is buying comparable
technologies, without economic justification.

<p>The economic model is one of an arms race, where all parties must
escalate their information competitiveness, thus largely nullifying
one another. That results in winners as well as losers, as is the case
in all warfare. It is the random distribution of profitability of both
the winners and the losers, when plotted against estimated IT
spending, that leads to the random pattern of no correlation between
IT spending and corporate profits.

<p>The progress in IT has exacerbated this randomness by making it
possible to change the rules of economic warfare at an accelerating
rate. The history of warfare offers lessons in why and how this can
happen. The English archers defeated the French knights in armor. The
German blitzkrieg bypassed France's Maginot Line. The prospects of
"Star Wars" made masses of Soviet tanks and artillery irrelevant. In
each of these cases, wealth-draining investments in military assets
turned out to be liabilities as resources were wasted and abandoned.
The defenders couldn't buy their way out of defeat by spending more
money on what were the sources of their fundamental economic failures
to begin with.

<p>What is different now is that in the Information Age, winners can
be dislodged in less than two typical technology cycles, or less than
14 years. That wasn't the case in the Industrial Age, when the rise
and fall of corporations took much longer because large capital
investments and entrenched economic positions favored the established
firms.

<p>The uncritical assumption that just pouring more money into
computer budgets will make it possible to keep up with an increasingly
costly technology race is a prescription for failure. While the
computer paradox persists, the best way of winning is to avoid
overspending on obsolescent systems and to reduce operating costs.
This makes more money available for innovation and rapid adaptation as
the rules of economic warfare evolve.

that IT executives learn more about guerrilla tactics where
underresourced, but innovative strategies may still lead to victory.
