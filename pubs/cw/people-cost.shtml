The battlefield of Microsoft vs. Sun, IBM, Novell, Netscape and Oracle
has been redefined in terms of the companies' Total Ownership Cost (TOC)
claims.<p>

The missiles in this battle are press releases and consultants'
estimates of the TOC of network computers, network personal computers
and personal computers.<p>

     <h3>The TOC Claims</h3>

The basis for the widely quoted estimates of TOC remains shrouded in
mystery. Granted, everyone includes the costs of equipment and operating
system software. But those numbers aren't decisive because they can
account for as little as 16% of a TOC.<p>

The various estimates don't explain what else is included. For instance,
the "Cost of End-User Operations," which makes up 56% of Gartner Group's
TOC, doesn't reveal how much of that is forunplanned downtime, how long
it takes to recover from system crashes, time lost in recovering data,
the negative revenue impact, how that affects customers and how much
time is wasted before someone calls the help desk.<p>

Instead, one finds vague references to "futz" factors. Yet, blaming
futzing has little meaning in the absence of explaining who, when, why
and how it happens. There's no reason to believe any of that would
diminish with a network computer or a NetPC.<p>

Consequently, IS managers are in a quandary. How can they reconcile
Gartner's estimate of $9,784, Zona Research's $3,679, Forrester
Research's $2,680 and Entext's Information Services' $1,500? How can one
believe pronouncements from Oracle that its Network Computer would have
"costs equal to that of a TV"? How can anyone accept that Microsoft can
field PCs that have "zero administration costs"?<p>

There's a simple answer: You can't reconcile any of the conflicting
claims. In the absence of adequate disclosures about what makes up the
various cost components, any comparisons of TOCs are guesses. No one is
itemizing the verifiable costs of what matters the most: the people who
try to use a network computer in their jobs.<p>

<h3>The Business View</h3>

The total ownership cost depends on what one counts. Just consider that
an equipment purchase of $3,000, amortized over four years and operating
for 52 five-day weeks, would cost 36 cents per hour. A typical
information worker earning $40,000 per year would cost at least $40 per
hour.<p>

The biggest contributors to idling workers aren't failures of
semiconductors or disk errors. When work stops, it's predominantly a
reflection of systems management practices, software reliability and
user behavior. Identical networks that have identical equipment
configurations will experience widely different failure characteristics,
depending on the quality of network management and the capabilities of
the people. <p>

I'm on the board of directors of a network management company that
operates client/server networks for a fixed fee per client. I obtained
the following listing of customer help desk calls for a typical time
period:<p>

<ul>

<li>Ninety-eight calls were made primarily because the PC users didn't
know what to do. I doubt that swapping computers would overcome such a
lack of employee training.<p>

<li>Ninety-four calls reported that the printer didn't work. That's not
anything that a downloadable Java applet or a diskless computer could
cure.<p>

<li>There were 43 incidents of failed log-on attempts. Only improved
administrative practices and reduced employee turnover could remedy
that.<p>

<li>In 40 instances, somebody kicked or loosened the connecting cables.
I have yet to hear an argument that lower-cost computer equipment will
simplify the ever-present cabling hazards.<p>

<li>Only 84 calls conceivably could have been fixed by choosing a more
robust and reliable client/server configuration, such as eliminating
operating system crashes (31 incidents for Windows 95), automating
resolution of error messages (28 incidents) and resolving NT 3.51
Pentium server downtime (25 incidents).<p>

</ul>

The above network is exceptionally well-managed, with a competitive
outsourcing price per seat of less than $3,000 per year. Even after
applying superior administration and automated diagnostic aids, 77% of
the cost of ownership was largely attributable to human errors that were
only vaguely related to choosing different equipment.<p>

<h3>The Significance</h3>

Computer executives shouldn't believe that mere changes in network
configuration will reduce their TOC. Those responsible for justifying IS
spending would be well-advised to examine notonly the technology
expenses that show up in their IS budgets but also the personnel and
business consequences if computer-aided people don't do what they're
supposed to do.<p>

As for Microsoft, Sun, Oracle and a long list of consultants, IS
managers should be aware that the public relations missile barrages are
mostly vapor trails. Until verifiable operating results become available
about the ability of employees to complete their work efficiently, one
should suspend judgment about any expected savings from a proposition
that doesn't recognize that humans will always cost more than
computers.<p>
