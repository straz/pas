ine years ago, the U.S. received its first official warning</font>
that an adversary may precede hostile military actions by launching a
Pearl Harbor-like attack on the nation's information infrastructure.
It took six years (and several advisory committees - I sat on three)
for a presidential directive to create the National Infrastructure
Protection Center (NIPC) within the FBI. <P>

The NIPC was chartered as the national center for gathering
information on threats, evaluating cyberattack risks, facilitating
government responses to computer-based incidents, coordinating
corporate countermeasures and monitoring recovery after an
infrastructure attack.<P>

Three years have passed. There is now overwhelming evidence that our
enemies are counting on information warfare as the most expedient way
to inflict damage on the U.S. Our military command and control
systems, power generation, telecommunications, transportation and
energy supplies continue to be vulnerable to information-induced
failures.<P>

So, how well is the NIPC guarding the national infrastructure? How
good is the assumption that your firm's computer systems will be
guarded against major disruptions? How well can you count on your
federal sentries to allow you to relax?<P>

The FBI, following its traditions, has treated information warfare as
a form of criminal activity in which a perpetrator must be caught,
indicted, then brought to trial. Most of its activity to date has been
tactical, chasing individual incidents, such as complaints about
denial-of-service attacks.<P>

The NIPC isn't yet capable of analyzing warning signs, assessing
vulnerabilities and issuing advance warnings of pending attacks. It
hasn't established information-sharing links with most government
agencies and the private sector, as it was chartered to do. The NIPC's
roles and responsibilities haven't been adequately defined and are
still subject to bureaucratic disputes that have resulted in poor
cooperation.<P>

For instance, the Federal CIO Council directs government agencies to
report security incidents to the General Services Administration, not
the NIPC. The Secret Service isn't cooperating with the NIPC. The NIPC
doesn't have access to essential industry data such as the
identification of critical systems components, known systems
vulnerabilities and the mapping of respective interdependencies.<P>

Though the president established 2003 as the goal for putting all
protective missions in operation, the NIPC doesn't have a schedule of
priorities, milestones and program performance measures. Why? Largely
because it's unclear who's directing its mission. Is it the National
Security Council, the Treasury Department, the FBI director or the
Department of Criminal Investigation at the Justice Department?<P>

Though the FBI's 1998 strategic plan identified the protection of the
national information infrastructure as one of its highest priorities,
ensuing actions haven't reflected that. The NIPC is tucked away within
the FBI's counterterrorism division, reporting to the assistant
director of one of 11 divisions. So seasoned Washington bureaucrats
don't recognize this as an indication of high priority.<P>

Staffing at the NIPC is woefully inadequate, with fewer than 100
employees, many of them on temporary assignment. The position of chief
of the Analysis and Warning Section (the key operating position) has
been vacant for half of the organization's existence, while only 13 of
the 24 budgeted analyst positions are filled. And repeated requests
for more staff have been rejected. When the General Accounting Office
interviewed the NIPC's analysts, most of them revealed negative
attitudes about their work experiences.<P>

When - not if - your lights go out and not even your uninterruptible
power supply will revive your blue screens, don't always blame your
power company or software supplier. You may have become a "collateral
victim" (that's Pentagonspeak) of an information warfare attack. In
such a case, you may have to revert to primitive ways of handling
information. The best you can do is add "information warfare" to your
list of contingencies for which to plan.<P>
