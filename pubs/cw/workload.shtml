<h2>Workload without Payoff</h2>

Government regulations deserve much of the blame for the low payoff
from IT. Major US companies spend  billions of dollars on computer
processing for federal reports</font><p>

There's an old trick I used when I was a CIO. Whenever I had to
explain to my boss why I needed to increase the IT budget, I showed a
long list of new government reporting requirements: accounting,
personnel, environmental safety, Equal Opportunity administrators,
warehousing and health care. That list always grew. There were years
when I could explain that more than 20% of my requests for more money
offered no other payoff than the avoidance of penalties or even jail
sentences.<p>

So I've always suspected that one of the likely explanations of the "computer
paradox" - defined as rising computer expenditures without any evidence of
rising productivity - was spending that generated no additional value, such
as responding to government requirements.<p>

Despite all the government initiatives claiming to cut
business-reporting burdens, more than 200,000 extra pages of laws,
regulations and administrative instructions from Washington, state
capitals, counties and municipalities every years according to Forbes
magazine. The result: new workloads.<p>

Federal paperwork compliance costs ranging from $2,267 to $6,726 a
year per employee, depending on a firm's size and industry
classification, according to economics professor Thomas D. Hopkins in
his November 1995 report to the U.S.  Small Business Administration,
``Profiles of Regulatory Costs.'' Using Hopkins' estimates, I've been
able to compare compliance costs with statistics to which a corporate
CIO can relate.<p>

<h3>Paperwork, the hidden tax</h3>

To see how the cost of government paperwork affects companies, I
compared Hopkins' numbers with data on corporate overhead and taxes
paid from 1994. I extracted from the Disclosure Incorporated database
information about the taxes paid by the 2,808 largest taxpaying U.S.
corporations, with 29.4 million employees. I also collected data on
corporate overhead on about 667 major U.S.  corporations, with 2
million employees, who didn't pay any taxes.<p>

Taxpaying corporations spent an estimated $98 billion in federal
paperwork in 1994, so Washington could collect $175 billion in taxes.
Without the paperwork, corporate pre-tax profits could have been 20%
higher. Some firms incurred as much as $10 of compliance paperwork for
every dollar of taxes paid. Such high ratios are the consequence of a
disproportionate burden of paperwork on smaller companies who have to
fill out the same forms as giant corporations.<p>

Companies that didn't pay any taxes incurred an estimated total
compliance cost of $6.3 billion. Without the paperwork their pre-tax
losses would have been cut by a quarter. One hundred and eleven
companies not paying taxes would have reported pre-tax income instead
of pre-tax losses.<p>

To what extent did the federal paperwork compliance cost explain
corporate overhead? One measure is the number reported as Sales,
General &amp; Administrative (S.G.&amp; A) expense. For the taxpaying
corporations, the compliance costs accounted for 9.8% of their
S.G.&amp; A., exceeding total expenses for research and development in
almost every instance.<p>

All together, 55% of 3,477 major U.S. firms spent more on paperwork to
comply with federal regulations than they paid in taxes in 1994,
amounting to a 59% tax surcharge.<p>

My database includes information about more than 600 corporate IT
budgets and how they relate to corporate overhead. A dollar's worth of
corporate administrative costs consumes anywhere from 15 to 25 cents
of computer expenses. That suggests that about $30 billion of computer
processing is required just for reporting to the federal government
for the 600 major corporations.  This amounts to about 10% of all IT
budgets: computer time for work that creates no economic-value added.<p>

 I have no data on comparable expenses for state and local
governments, but processing their demands is likely to represent a
noticeable addition on top of federal requirements.<p>

<h3>Implications for CIOs</h3>

<ul>

<li>These findings illuminate some of the causes of the ``computer
paradox.''  Corporate overhead costs rose 42% from 1988 through 1994
and grew faster than revenues or profits despite a 67% rise in
computer expenditures.  Government-dictated paperwork diminishes
productivity gains realized in the delivery of improved performance to
paying customers. No one should expect increased profits from
computerization if government requirements increase the number of
inspectors, clerks, administrators and auditors disproportionately.<p>

<li>Information management chiefs should become spokesmen about the impacts of
government paperwork burdens. Despite Washington's frequent claims about
reducing corporate paperwork, the only place where this can be clearly
demonstrated is by displaying, at budget time, the firm's costs of handling
government paperwork. CIOs should reveal what the paperwork does to their
firms' profits.<p>
