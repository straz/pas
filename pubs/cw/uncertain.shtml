<font size="+1">Turnover of chief information officers</font> among
America's largest corporations has gone from bad to disastrous. In two
years, it's shot up from 24% to 40%.<P>

Last year, I wrote about the dangers of CIO turnover [<a
href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/jobholding.shtml">CW, June 10,
1996</a>]. I matched names on 1994 and 1995 CIO mailing lists. After
counting the dropouts, I calculated a one-year turnover rate of 24%.
That indicated an average on-the-job CIO tenure expectancy of 30
months. It was an unacceptable turnover rate. It would force American
IS organizations to devote most of their attention to patching up
failing operations or satisfying pressing needs through costly
improvisations.<P>

I just obtained the updated mailing list. This time I was able to
compare the respective 1996 and 1997 CIO names for the 300 largest
U.S. corporations. To my shock, I found that the attrition rate of
CIOs has accelerated. This year, 103 companies have appointed new
CIOs. The departures from the list include several prominent people
who over the years have received CIO leadership awards and other
accolades. Only 152 named CIOs remained in their jobs during the past
year. That means we have experienced a staggering 40% turnover
rate.<P>

But that's not all. That rate is understated, because it accounts for
only the 255 companies that made the top 300 list both years. What
about the other 45 companies? <P>

Some companies that appeared on the 1996 list weren't among the top
300 companies this year. Others didn't claim a CIO last year but
listed one this year. Still others failed to designate their top IT
position last year. All that suggests turmoil in IS, or at least a
need for change in IT leadership, that's greater than is fully
accountable by name matching.<P>

<h3>Why the Attrition Rate?</h3>

One can endlessly speculate about why a CIO lost or gained a position:
personality clashes, personal failures, etc. But the 40% turnover rate
suggests something deeper is at work.<P>

The latest rapid departures of corporate IT leaders isn't a random and
temporary happening such as sunspots or sudden shifts in ocean
currents. It's the end of an era of abdication of responsibility for
information management by top corporate executives. It signals the end
of a 40-year epoch during which technology prevailed over
economics.<P>

The turnover and turmoil you see today marks the beginning of a
painful phase, after which the dominance of economics over technology
and the need to integrate IT into the business mainstream will finally
happen.<P>

We are dealing here with a major shift in the business model and power structure.<P>

Uncertain leadership may encourage IT professionals to become even
more short-term-oriented than before. One can recognize that trend in
how companies adopt, customize and maintain packaged systems solutions
without giving much thought to the long-term consequences for their IT
budgets. Outsourcing also continues to offer the fastest relief from
pain without necessarily curing the causes of defective management
practices. I have reviewed enough year 2000 fix-it plans to observe
that leadership uncertainty is forcing more and more IT shops into
patching and working around their problems instead of fixing the data.
That will push the costs of year 2000-induced maintenance into the
next decade.<P>

I don't believe that the short-term opportunists will prevail. When
the planning and control of the full life-cycle costs of ownership of
computers become a required corporate practice, only those who know
how to deal with that will be asked to remain. Information technology
isn't just an expense; it's an investment. Those who propose and
install those investments will have to stay around while the promised
benefits materialize. Top corporate management will finally see to it
that responsibility and accountability reflect the same time line.<P>

his <a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/iep.html">four books</a> on
the economics of information, that taking a long-range view of IT
investments has the best chance of delivering profitable results.
