<font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">n 2000, the CIO Magazine Tech
Poll reported a 22% annual growth rate in IT budgets.</font> The same poll
has recorded growth rates below 2% from January 2002 to the present.
For the past two years, CIOs have persistently predicted a resurgence
in IT spending. But the harsh reality is that chief financial officers
now dictate IT spending, and they will throttle IT budgets until
there's hard evidence that IT delivers profits.<p>

<P>How CFOs can extract proof of IT profitability is a source of
puzzlement. During the years of easy IT money, the established
procedures for capital budgeting couldn't cope with a growing appetite
for computerization. Now that companies have slammed on the brakes,
CFOs are searching for new ways to harness IT.

<P>The most elaborate scheme yet is the one the Office of Management
and Budget conceived for constraining the more than $57 billion in
annual federal IT spending (or $32,000 per employee). OMB efforts,
conducted under the federal enterprise architecture and e-government
strategies, are scripts for imposing order and uniformity on an IT
landscape that comprises more than 100 independent agencies and
includes more than 5,000 major projects. The OMB plan reflects the
thinking of many CFOs and is therefore worthy of attention. It would
do the following:

<ul>
<P><b>1. Impose a standard method for classifying IT expenses.</b><br> An
elaborate business-reference model defines how to describe the
business operations of the federal government. The purpose is to
capture information about any duplication of efforts.

<P><b>2. Prescribe a self-appraisal method for characterizing the
performance of IT, with an emphasis on identifying system
deficiencies.</b><br> The purpose is to identify targets where IT spending
must be examined.

<P><b>3. Require classification of governmentwide standard IT
components to enable consolidation of application development.</b><br> The
purpose is to set the stage for centralized procurement of software
and services.

<P><b>4. Direct IT organizations to conform with a technical reference
model for reuse of technology.</b><br> The purpose is to establish
favorable conditions for creating a shared infrastructure that would
save money.

<P><b>5. Require the submission of a "business case" for every
project.</b><br> It's through the scrutiny of such business cases that the
CFO intends to assert budgetary controls. OMB officials have already
declared that "771 projects in FY04 budget (for $20.9B) are 'at risk'
and will not be allowed to proceed." So how do OMB budget examiners
sort out which of the more than 5,000 projects are at risk?
</ul>

<P>The so-called business-case forms have been conceived by auditors
for budget examiners. For each project, the CIO of the organization
must fill out a form containing 132 detailed questions about the best
IT practices ever conceived by consultants. The checklist covers
topics such as demonstrated fit with business strategy, linking to
management plans, support of a modernization strategy, demonstration
of low-risk acquisition methods, proofs of strong project management,
closing of performance gaps, assurance of security over a project's
life cycle, privacy protection, paperwork reduction, management of
risk-adjusted life cycle costs -- and many others.

<P>For good measure, the business-case forms require documented
confirmation of compliance with a long list of regulatory and
legislative measures.

<P>To sort out which projects are at risk, the OMB follows a routine
procedure. First, each item for every project is rated on a scale from
1 to 5.

<P>Second, all of the scores are added up, regardless of their
importance, though a poor score in a few selected areas (such as
security) will automatically disqualify the entire project. If the
scores fall below predefined levels, the project is classified as
being at risk and scheduled for further examination. Projects with low
scores won't be funded.

<P>How effective is the OMB methodology in delivering the stated
objectives of savings through sharing of IT resources? One way of
judging that is to examine the OMB schedule of fiscal 2004
governmentwide sharing of IT. If you remove unique Homeland Security
Department projects, you end up with only 0.21% of the total federal
IT budget as benefiting from synergy through sharing. I guess that
leaves the OMB -- like many CFOs -- with the hatchet-on-a-pole method
of IT budget pruning and management.
