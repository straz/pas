<font size="+2">H</font><font size="+1">ow will last month's terrorist
attacks affect corporate IT?</font> Hijacking and crashing four
jetliners was only one move in a concerted campaign to disrupt global
commerce, damage U.S. economic interests, erode U.S.  power and foment
distrust in the conduct of international business.  Given those
objectives, I'm quite sure that high on terrorists' checklists is a
plan to wreck the Internet. If they can stop Internet traffic for a
day or two, the effect on business, and particularly on the future of
IT, would be devastating.<P>

Current configuration and management practices for securing the
Internet are roughly comparable to what has so far passed for airport
security measures. Communications protocols were designed for
cooperative ease of use, not security. <P>

The software that runs the servers possesses known security holes
through which increasingly virulent attacks are launched every day.
The software that operates our desktops has been designed for
convenience and is readily exploited by available attack tools. A
large portion of more than 100 million powerful PCs and more than 10
million servers can, in an instant, be commandeered to serve as
engines that amplify anything terrorists launch, guaranteeing their
anonymity and becoming weapons of mass corruption of Internet
services. Thus, an IT network that's negligently managed and known to
be insecure becomes part of the terrorist's arsenal in information
warfare.<P>

All IT assets in the U.S. should now be seen as operating in a war zone.<P>

What could we see in this war zone? The most probable scenario is an
attempt to collapse the Internet through a massive denial-of-service
attack. One can begin when malicious code is implanted in unprotected
computers or when the attacking code sneaks past defenses
unrecognized. The infected host is then induced to pass the attack
package to others. Damage is inflicted by all compromised computers,
which become generators of a huge volume of messages and make all
other systems inaccessible by overloading networks with useless
traffic so that legitimate users can't access Internet resources. When
that happens, operators must disconnect the infected devices, and
often, they must also reformat their drives and reinstall all software
from a secure source.<P>

That would fit a terrorist's idea of a perfect crime. Just like the
attack on the World Trade Center, the target contributes to the spread
of damages. The recovery processes magnify the victims' suffering.
Meanwhile, an affected information system remains inoperable, and the
personnel who depend on it are unable to work. Even if an attack
fails, the terrorist wins because he can learn from each failure.
Attacks are cheap and almost impossible to prevent, and damages can be
enormous. That's why defending the Internet's integrity should be a
public priority. <P>

The Internet's current vulnerability is largely the result of gaping
holes in the design of operating systems that power servers. Vendors
will offer "patches" to plaster over known cracks but will never fix
the systems' architectures. That's why you receive one patch after
another, each covering yet another variant of the same vulnerability.
When you're operating in a war zone, you can't tolerate such conduct,
because you could unwittingly become an accomplice to cyberterrorism.
The solution lies in mandating government testing, certification and
standards, just as prescription drugs, automobiles and buildings are
regulated to assure public safety.<P>

The Net's vulnerability is the product of sloppy IT practices. Today,
even driving a car or operating a bulldozer requires formal training,
an examination, certification and adherence to codes. IT, which has
become the lifeblood of America in the past 30 years, leaves network
operations to individuals who have no legal accountability. In the
information war zone, you can't tolerate such leniency. <P>

The freewheeling, undisciplined days of network management practices
are over. If your organization is connected to the Internet, IT must
assume the added responsibility of blocking access by information
terrorists. <P>
