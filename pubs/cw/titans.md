History teaches us that a
challenge to a superior power can succeed only by changing the rules
under which any confrontation takes place. Head-on attacks on strong,
entrenched positions are easily repelled. That's why RCA, Honeywell,
Xerox, GE, Burroughs, Univac, Amdahl and many others failed when they
tried to compete with IBM. That's why the computing landscape over the
past 15 years has become littered with so many gravestones of firms
overcome by Microsoft.

Now a new Microsoft challenger is emerging on the horizon:
Google. What makes Google different is that it follows innovative
rules as it carves out a share of the IT business. Google's emerging
strategy may give us a clue as to who may be bidding for IT leadership
in our uncertain industry by the end of this decade.

Microsoft's power is based on selling customers software that
becomes a sequence of increasingly sticky entanglements. Once you've
installed Microsoft operating software on a desktop, laptop or cell
phone, the steadily increasing inclusiveness of features will raise
your costs for choosing any alternative. Google, on the other hand,
relies on a generic browser to gain access to a rapidly growing menu
of services.

Microsoft's business model is based on mass distribution of
software, where economies of scale generate high profit
margins. Revenue growth depends on extending software functionality,
and the customer pays for each upgrade. Google's business model is
based on offering added services based on economies of scale in
operations and on innovation. Revenue growth results from extending
the economic utility of services that the customer can add at low
cost.

Microsoft's superior profits are based on passing on just about all
the costs -- including those of support labor and capital -- to the
customer.  When you adopt the Microsoft environment, you can't ever
budget for the total costs of ownership in the long run. Google is a
network services provider. Google owns and operates perhaps the
world's largest computer complex, consisting of a rapidly growing
population of 100,000 servers that manage petabytes of data with
unprecedented reliability and response time. Google pays for all of
its labor and capital out of its pocket. You pay only for what you
get.

Microsoft can expand its business by leaving to the customer the
job of tending to most of the burdensome tasks of integrity,
interoperability, reliability, security and maintainability. These
tasks now absorb perhaps as much as 75% of the total cost of user
ownership. This overhead baggage is slowing down the implementation of
new applications. Google removes the customer overhead altogether by
delivering defined services, with a predictable performance.

Microsoft leaves the management of knowledge capital, which is
represented by the data and the files spinning on disks, largely in
the hands of users. Enterprise knowledge management is now almost
entirely dominated by IBM and Oracle (and, arguably, by
SAP). Microsoft has recognized that this is the source of its greatest
competitive vulnerability. It has now targeted the extension of its
dominance from desktops (where it has a near monopoly) to dominance
over servers (where it is behind). This would be achieved by making
server and desktop software functionally inseparable. 

Google's view is that what matters is not data but the content that
clusters of information arrayed with intelligence may convey. Google
is committed to extracting meaning (not data) by means of
nonproprietary standards from files that may be scattered but are
nevertheless accessible.

The transfer of data from paper to computers has characterized the
first 50 years of computing. The next era will deal with the transfer
of intelligence from computers to people. The proliferation of data
and the inability to extract information from it is the problem we
must overcome. Consider the inefficiencies in the prevailing
practices. My first computer used a 160KB floppy disk to store
everything. Now I need two 160GB disks just to keep up. That scales up
by a factor of a million, and I see that headed for a billion. 

Yet everything I put on my computers prior to 1997 has been lost as
I migrated hardware and software configurations. At the enterprise
level, the losses of institutional memory are even more severe. This
sort of memory failure has become a characteristic of all
computer-based organizations, as millions of disk drives fill up with
redundant, and unretrievable, information stashed away in proprietary
formats. 

As we evolve toward data-centric architectures (see [Why IT Will Continue to Matter](it-continue.html)), the
management of systems for collaboration and for knowledge sharing will
be central to profitable investments in IT. Judging from Google's
research and its current marketing probes, it appears to be focused on
competing for this opportunity. How Microsoft proposes to address this
challenge is yet to be seen.
