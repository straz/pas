<font size="+2">Until now, all year 2000 estimates</font> came from conjecture, opinion
polls, guesswork and questionable extrapolations by often
self-anointed experts.

<P> We have, for the first time, information about year 2000 costs and
progress from an authoritative source: first-quarter 1998 reports
filed by U.S. corporations listed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). The information was compiled by Triaxsys Research.

<P> The reports conform to regulations issued last year. The data has
greater credibility than anything published so far because it is
likely to be used in any litigation against corporate officers and
directors.

<P> To understand what this wealth of year 2000 information means,
relate it to the characteristics of corporations that file reports
with the SEC. The total revenue of the 4,260 listed firms that must
report is about $6.6 trillion. For the first quarter of 1998 (covering
financial data through 1997), the SEC identifies only 85 major
companies with year 2000 budgets greater than $10 million. That
includes the nation's largest companies.

<P> Although the number of firms with reported year 2000 budgets is
very small, together they account for 19% of all corporate revenue and
24% of all corporate profits. Clearly, the firms that are ready to
talk about their year 2000 progress are the premier U.S.
organizations. Those organizations plan to spend a total of $9.4
billion to fix their date-change problems. Because they represent a
mix of industries, I was able to come up with a cost estimate for the
entire U.S. corporate population on the basis of revenue. Such an
estimate suggests that the total budget for fixing any year 2000
headaches for corporate America is only about $50 billion -- a number
much smaller than any prognostications so far, by a wide margin!

<P> Now comes the interesting part. Although the 85 big companies plan
to spend a total of $9.4 billion, they've spent only 29% of that
amount to date, which suggests that corporate America is ready to pay
only about $36 billion for fixing the year 2000 situation in the time
that remains. Can that be accomplished?

<P> I have data for IT budgets for 29 of the firms that reported their
year 2000 budgets to the SEC. With high reliability, I can now predict
the expected year 2000 spending if a firm follows known patterns. That
analysis suggests that in the time remaining, year 2000 spending will
siphon off only 8.3% of annual IT budgets. That calls for a material
shift in the budgets toward software services, but is quite manageable
despite moans and groans that failure is imminent because the job
can't be completed. In fact, if this money is used prudently to
correct the inherent flimsiness of the existing software, it may be a
good investment.

<P> Before we dismiss all the alarmists of the coming doom, note that
I don't think we should depend entirely on the data that has been
filed with the SEC. The shattering revelation in the reported details
is that only four firms so far claim they've progressed with complete
systems testing.

<P> Until test results are independently validated and verified, we
can't place much credence on easy prospects of fixing the year 2000
disease.

<P> The old advice "Trust, but verify," is more applicable to software
than to any other human activity.

<P> My advice is to proceed immediately with testing a representative
sample of critical systems. The experiences gained from such a pilot
would confirm whether the estimates filed with the SEC are fiction or
reality.<p>
