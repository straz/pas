<font size="+2">Knowledge management and intellectual capital</font>
are the buzzwords that have launched a thousand books, articles and
conferences. Are they just another passing fad, or do they offer
useful measures of performance?<p>

That's hard to tell. As yet, nobody practicing knowledge management
has succeeded in measuring whether their knowledge assets have
increased or diminished. The measurement schemes out there are jumbles
of facts, subjective evaluations and opinions. These schemes show only
that knowledge management is evolving from magic to astrology and is
still far from offering managers repeatable, unambiguous and useful
metrics. To overcome that deficiency, I will show that knowledge
assets are indeed quantifiable. Here's a way to measure knowledge
based on hard numbers, not opinions.<p>

<h3>Linking knowledge assets AND financial measures</h3>

The true measure of knowledge is in observing outputs.<p>

The surest way to determine an organization's worth is to sell it. The
price reflects whether the company's worth is greater than its
reported financial assets. That happens during mergers, acquisitions,
buyouts and whenever company stock is traded. The value of a company's
knowledge can be explained as the difference between its reported
financial assets and its actual market value, which is the share price
multiplied by the number of shares.<p>

Unfortunately, it's impractical to calculate the value of a company's
knowledge that way. Stock prices fluctuate for reasons unrelated to
anything employees may know. Hostile acquisition offers don't
necessarily reflect the acquirer's esteem for the knowledge of the
company's managers. Therefore, one must seek out valuation in ways
that reflect the economic values the employees create.<p>

<h3>Calculating Knowledge Capital&reg;</h3>

Knowledge Capital forms when employees think or talk about how they
are delivering goods and services. That usually occurs when workers
are engaged in overhead tasks, not when they're actually delivering
goods or services.<p>

If learning, training, talking, writing and communicating make for
improved productivity, it will reveal itself as improved economic
performance and will become measurable in dollars. That real money is
the return on the newly created Knowledge Capital. It discloses the
value of the knowledge that has been unleashed by informed actions.<p>

<h3>What are the measurable annual outputs from the accumulation of knowledge?</h3>

I call that "information value-added"; economists call it net surplus
economic value. It's what's left after you pay suppliers, the
government, employees, creditors and shareholders and after you
replace obsolete assets. But information value-added isn't the same as
Knowledge Capital. Knowledge Capital is that intangible source that
makes it possible to generate annual profits. To state it another way:
If Knowledge Capital is the principal, then information value-added is
its annual yield. If you know what the investors' minimum expected
rate of return is, it's easy to calculate the worth of the asset from
which it originates.

<h3>That approach makes Knowledge Capital a calculable number. </h3>

Take, for example, the valuation of the Knowledge Capital for
Microsoft. At the end of 1996, its financial capital was $7 billion.
After subtracting from its 1996 profits of $2.2 billion the interest
payments for the capital, which was $210 million, we are left with
Microsoft's information value-added of $2 billion. To generate such an
amount implies, using Microsoft's low cost of equity capital, the
presence of an intangible principal of $67 billion ($2 billion divided
by .03, the fraction of financial capital used to pay interest), which
is then Microsoft's Knowledge Capital.<p>

It just happens that the stock market valuation of Microsoft at the
end of 1996 was $98.6 billion. In other words, exuberant investors
attributed to Microsoft a Knowledge Capital valuation of $91.6 billion
($98.6 billion minus $7 billion in financial assets). Any way you look
at it, Microsoft's Knowledge Capital lies somewhere between $67
billion and $91.6 billion.<p>

A comparable analysis of 359 U.S. industrial companies shows Knowledge
Capital worth $1.7 trillion, or 217% of their net financial assets.
Clearly, knowledge is more important than what the accountants record
as tangible assets.<p>

<h3>Putting the measures to work</h3>

The gain in the worth of a company's Knowledge Capital is arguably the
most important indicator of its success in the Information Age. It
should be instrumental in changing the attitudes of accounting-minded
executives about the value of information. <p>

For example, if a company scraps 100 forklift trucks before their
depreciation is written off, it would be recorded as a loss for
accounting purposes. But if 1,000 employees with career-life learning
costs of at least $150 million leave a corporation, none of the
financial reports would reflect that as a loss. And the stock market
may actually recognize it as a gain.  Many of the faults with today's
information management practices can be traced to such bias, which
favors accounting over knowledge-generating assets.<p>

One can view Knowledge Capital as the consequence of a stream of
expenses that makes a company more effective. Meetings may contribute
to greater employee awareness. Training is useful if put to good use.
Software need not be an expense if it's reused. Everything that
contributes to an accumulation of knowledge can become a capital
investment with sound information management practices.<p>

Every manager should, therefore, monitor which portion of his overhead
expense is temporary and how much of it builds capital. Such
monitoring is possible by tracking a firm's overhead-to-Knowledge
Capital conversion efficiency. For example, the 10-year sum of all
overhead expenses for a prominent pharmaceutical company adds up to
$18.9 billion. For that period, I calculated its Knowledge Capital
growth as $8.6 billion. With a conversion efficiency of 45.5%, that
firm belongs to the U.S. elite, and I can prove that by numbers, not
by opinion surveys. (Microsoft's overhead-to-Knowledge Capital
conversion efficiency is a spectacular 451%.)<p>

<h3>Implications for CIOs </h3>

 By recognizing that Knowledge Capital is a measurable quantity, the
executives in charge of information management should be able to shift
from their preoccupation with short-run expense efficiency to a new
perspective: how to create valuable knowledge assets. The right set of
measures will help in explaining and justifying how to accomplish that
objective.<p>
