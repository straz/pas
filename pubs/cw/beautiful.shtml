<h2>Productivity, not Bigness, is Beautiful</h2>
<b>by Paul A. Strassmann<br><br>

There are a number of computer valuation schemes that publish a ranking of
excellence on the basis of a firm's information technology budget, the number
of LAN's, the number of personal computers and what have you. In these schemes
bigness weighs in always as being better. <p>

There are also a number of computer excellence ranking schemes that totally
dispense with numbers, and rely on consultants and experts to judge
accomplishments by reputation. Unfortunately, what constitutes a "reputation"
in business nowadays is largely shaped by press releases from large
corporations. These approaches, more often than not, offer misleading clues to
what information systems professionals should admire. <p>

What matters is productivity of a firm, regardless of its size, number of
client/servers or how many systems professionals it employs. To test this
proposition I took the 1995 CW Premier 100 companies (see CW of XX October),
which ranked corporations by Information Productivity and compared them with
the top 100 Fortune corporations which were ranked by revenue. <p>

In 1994 the average Fortune 100 company was 24 times larger in sales, 13 times
larger in shareholder equity, 38 times larger in sales, general &amp;
administrative expense, six times larger in research and development and 12
times larger in employment than the CW Premier 100 companies, shown in the
following table:<p>

<p>
How well did companies ranked by revenue compare with companies ranked by
Information Productivity for the period from 1992 through 1994? <p>
<p>
The CW Premier 100 companies delivered 347% better sales growth, 334% better
growth in shareholder equity and grew employment by 46.2% while the big 100
corporations cut employment. <p>
<p>
There will be skeptics who will question the above findings because I have
examined on only two small sets of data. They should realize that to come up
with a listing of the CW Premier 100 companies, I ranked over 5,000 U.S.
corporations by Information Productivity. From those I picked the 904 highest
performing corporations with positive productivity results for the entire three
year period. I then sorted the high performance firms by revenue, as shown in
the following table:<p>

<b>Growth Rates of Companies</b>
                             >$1Billion    $500M-$1B    $100M-$500M   0-$100M

Avg. Information Productivity   0.151         0.164        0.206       0.227

</pre>
<p>
    321 companies with revenues of less than $100 million outpaced the 179
companies with revenues of over $1 billion in sales growth, net income growth,
growth in shareholder equity and employment. Meanwhile, these corporations
maintained a steady stream of investment in future growth, as suggested by
large increases in research and development expense.<p>
<p>
    If I were to seek a job nowadays, I would rather look up what
Computerworld has to say about my prospective employer, than what is printed in
other publications. However, before you decide to interview with only high
performance companies with sales of under $100 million, a word of caution is in
order. The employment opportunities remain with the big high performance
corporations.<p>

The moral of this story is simple. If you want to be associated with winners,
run a check on their productivity record. Big may be O.K. but only if it generates
economic growth and employment.<p>
