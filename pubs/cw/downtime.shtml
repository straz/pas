<b>Are you worried about total ownership costs (TOC)?<br>
 Don't place your faith only on changing technology.</b>
</blockquote><p>

Replacing old PCs with NCs or switching operating systems is not the
miraculous answer to the rising costs of computer networks. You'll
save more money if you improve reliability and security, and become a
superb manager of the technology you now have.<p>

Until recently we rarely heard much about the excessive costs of
personal computers, even though they can amount to as much as 40% of
the salaries paid to their users. Computer people kept quiet, because
they were preoccupied with obtaining money to buy hardware and
software. <p>

Top management only began to inquire about the full life-cycle cost of
computing when they recognized that computer ownership increasingly
includes costs that show up only in the users' operations. Today,
user-incurred costs such as &quot;futzing&quot; (wasting time on PCs),
improvised learning, assistance from fellow employees and end-user
attempts to become computer experts are showing up in the TOC
estimates published by consultants and vendors.<p>

<h3>Downtime Estimate</h3>

Still, something is missing. I have been bothered (see <a href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/real-costs.shtml">
Computerworld, 1/13/97</a>) by the lack of any allowances in TOC
calculations for the business consequences of network downtime.
Vendor claims and widely quoted consultant estimates do not include
that. Yet, I have data that suggest that many networked PC users
cannot perform their essential business tasks anywhere from two to
four hours per month. <p>

Frequently, these disruptions can lower employee productivity and hurt revenues. 
In business-critical applications, computer downtime equals the costs of idle labor. I have 
just completed a study of a network with 2,500 clients, 80 servers, 50 bridge/routers, 200 
hubs and 160 printers. The unplanned downtime for the clients was 1.6 hours per month 
per person. When I added  the interruptions caused by the servers, routers and hubs, it 
added up to 2.8 hours. For the entire network that was 84,000 hours of dysfunctional time 
a year. With user compensation averaging $32,000 per year, plus benefits, that could add 
up to a large waste of resources.<p>

<h3>The Total Cost Of Ownership Model</h3>

In revenue-creating applications, the losses from computer downtime
can be eves greater. According to a model from Interpose Corp.
(<a href="http://www.interpose.com">www.interpose.com</a>),
revenue losses per employee can equal several times an employee's
hourly compensation for every hour of downtime.<p>

Interpose, based in Altamonte Springs, Fla., offers the most
comprehensive software for estimating total ownership costs, including
expenses that do not show up in the IT budget. In addition to
calculating hardware and software component costs, it also includes
allowances for all other IT expenses:<p>

<ul>
<li>Network management (such as troubleshooting and repair, performance 
tuning and user administration);
<li>Systems management (such as technology evaluation, licensing, asset 
management, network security and installation of upgrades);
<li>Storage management (such as storage capacity planning, backup and 
archiving, and disaster planning);
<li>User support (such as training, vendor liaison, equipment relocation, 
trouble diagnosis and help desk operations).
</ul>

The model also includes losses in productivity attributable to end users as a cost of 
ownership:
<ul>
<li>Lost productivity and lost revenue from downtime. (The model 
estimates these losses from data, supplied by users, on factors such as 
salary, what portion of the person's time is critical, planned downtime, 
unplanned downtime, what portion of the population is affected, and how 
mission critical are those people.)
<li>Time spent in formal training;
<li>Cooperative training, when the user's peers interrupt work and offer 
tutoring;
<li>Casual training, such as learning from trial and error, or by perusing a 
manual;
<li>The cost of correcting errors resulting from the inability to operate the 
system;
<li>The ``futz factor'' -- the costs of users spending work hours using their 
PCs for entertainment and private purposes.
</ul>

<h3>The Downtime Effect</h3>

I ran the Interpose model for the network under study to calculate the
average cost per client station, including all of the standard cost
elements listed above. The effects calculated by the model were
remarkable: fully 48% of the $12,516 average cost per client would be
attributable to the revenue lost by downtime.<p>

Other end-user inefficiencies would account for only 12% of the TOC.
Futzing amounts to only 2.9% of the TOC. These results intrigued me.
The key influences on TOC were not the standard cost elements that
everybody talks about, but network reliability.<p>

Next I wanted to assess the value of the work that wasn't done because
of downtime. To estimate that value I related it to the salary: the
higher the user's salary, the higher their potential impact on loss in
revenues. In this way I assumed that the higher the compensation the
more likely is that person’s effect on business outcomes.  Salary will
be also a measure of lost productivity in case that person is unable
to function because the essential computer support has collapsed. <p>

I also examined the total costs of ownership for the identical 2,500 client network, 
assuming that it supported highly paid users (earning $90,000 a year). The losses due to 
downtime were even higher. For highly paid analysts, using low reliability network PCs 
(where downtime was 3.2 hours a month), the average cost per client was $29,100. In that 
case the costs of hardware and software would amount only to 8% of TOC! If these 
analysts were currency traders, and totally dependent on workstation up-time to conduct 
their business, the TOC would be much higher and the importance of hardware and 
software is not significant.<p>

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of TOC to downtime and
employee compensation deploying the identical hardware and software:<p>

<p>
                                      
For 2,500 Win95 clients, 80 WinNT servers, 50 bridge/routers, 200 hubs and 160 
printers the TOC can range anywhere from $29,100 to $8,503 depending on the value of 
the people sitting behind the displays and the business utility of the network. The choice 
of hardware and software technologies, that everyone talks about, can amount to 
anywhere from 8% to 27% of the TOC. Clearly, it is not the choice of technologies but the 
management of people and networks that are the decisive influence.<p>

<h3>CIO Implications</h3>

Making technical choices about operating systems (OS vs. UNIX vs. NT vs. Win 95) 
or about hardware (PC, NC or NetPC), or debating the merits of various administrative 
schema (such as the Zero Administration Cost initiative) does not predetermine the 
financial impacts of networked computers on organizations.<p>

It's not technology, but management effectiveness that drives the total cost to an 
enterprise for using networked computers in the execution of critical business tasks. It is 
management that can exercise the greatest influence on how an organization overcomes 
the revenue impact when networks fail to function. Only effective network management 
can deliver reliability and responsiveness to customer needs. Identical servers supporting 
identical clients, using identical routers, identical hubs and identical printers will show 
widely different TOCs depending on who uses them, what is the importance of 
computers in supporting critical applications and the reliability of the networked 
services.<p>

Top management is finally starting to ask questions why overhead
costs are up despite the introduction of supposedly inexpensive
computer networks. This time around it will not be prudent to offer
yet another technological fix as the cure for bloated IT budgets and
rising overhead costs.<p>

Paul A. Strassmann's new book,<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/squandered.html"> 
The Squandered Computer</a>, singles out excessive TOC's as the most
attractive target for immediate cost reductions.<p></font>
