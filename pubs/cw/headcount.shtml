We shouldn't give Industrial Age answers to Information Age questions.
Yet, that's still happening in the debates over whether computers have
increased productivity.<P>

Revenue per employee is still being used to measure the productivity
of information resources. The most notable recent example is the
publicity given to a Harvard Business School study. The study is an
example of how misleading measures lead to deceptive findings.<P>

<h3>The study</h3>

The Harvard researchers studied 250 life insurance companies. They
were searching for a relation between cuts in employment and gains in
productivity.<P>

Researchers chose insurance companies because they spend a higher
share of operating expenses on computers than most economic sectors
do. The findings were surprising. It was the firms' approach to
downsizing - and not IT - that made the difference in productivity. It
was not technology, but the behavioral and organizational
characteristics that mattered.<P>

The implications of those findings are readily apparent: It's not what
you do, but how you do it that delivers the results. Unfortunately,
the problem with these conclusions is that they all hinge on
productivity as defined in terms of revenue per employee. That measure
is unreliable. Therefore, although I agree with some of the
observations, the research conclusions aren't trustworthy. Here are
the reasons:<P>

<ol>

<li>Head count doesn't account for the cost of doing business in
insurance. The average salaries in insurance firms vary greatly, and
therefore, every head is not equal. The total cost of operations must
cover payroll expenses, as well as computers (up to 30% of payroll
dollars), telecommunications, purchased services, office facilities,
outsourcing fees and capital charges.<P>

<li>The Harvard study used life insurance premiums as the measure
of output. But insurance companies have diversified and have other
revenue streams besides premium income. These include fees such as
custodial charges and income from investments.<P>

<li>If output (defined as premium income) and input (defined as
head count) aren't reliable measures, then productivity (the ratio of
output over input) won't be reliable. Revenue per employee wouldn't
relate to any claims of productivity gains, particularly regarding IT,
since technology use affects operating costs as well as profit
margins.<P>

</ol>

For those reasons, it is necessary to abandon the revenue/head count
ratios not only in the insurance industry, but also in other business
sectors. This generalization is particularly relevant when making
claims about productivity gains from using IT to downsize the
workforce. A firm that outsources because of poor financial
performance could look unrealistically efficient by claiming that this
measure proves how well it's performing.<P>

<h3>Why head count-based measures are wrong</h3>

Comparing head count to judge how IT boosts productivity is just
wrong. In the information economy, unlike the industrial era, it's not
head count control that makes the difference in productivity. It's the
total cost and value of information, whether owned or purchased, which
explains the performance of an information-rich enterprise. <p>

I'm sensitive to this distinction because in my years as a CIO in
business and government, I witnessed the enormous damage done by
thoughtless and arbitrary hiring freezes, forced retirements and
downsizing. Head count ratio methods gave central planners a
blunt and crude hatchet when thoughtful ways to boost the
effectiveness of individuals could have delivered the identical
results with less pain - and at a lower cost.<P>

<h3>CIO Implications</h3>

Real incomes can rise only if there are real gains in productivity.
The U.S. insurance industry, one of the most extensively computerized
sectors of the economy, has shown only minimal gains in the past
decade.<P>

Using statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, I
analyzed 34 insurers whose financial records stretched back to 1987.
Nineteen added to their employment rolls in a 10-year period, while 15
downsized. I calculated the actual productivity numbers as a ratio of
revenues from all sources, divided by the total operating costs. For
those adding employees, the productivity improvement was 5.2% in 10
years. For those downsizing, the improvement was 6%.<P>

Those numbers amount to average annual gains of only 0.5% - a poor
showing when one considers that during the past century, the entire
U.S. economy delivered average annual productivity gains of more than
2.5%. There was little difference between the productivity gains of
those upsizing vs. those downsizing.<P>

Whatever gains in profits shareholders accrued in the past decade are
rooted in the steady decline in the costs of capital as interest rates
deflated. The gains didn't come from improved workforce productivity,
regardless of how many computers were installed.<P>

When the steady decline in interest rates finally reverses, as has
always happened before, improved profits will have to depend on
productivity gains. CIOs should adopt realistic measures to track such
improvements.<P>

Their expectations deserve better counsel than that offered by the
Harvard Business School researchers.<P>
