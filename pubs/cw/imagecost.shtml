Corporate America is slowly waking up to the shocking prospect of
having to sink between $300 billion and $600 billion to fix the year
2000 two-digit stumble. Now another $200 billion of avoidable annual
expense is coming to light. And money isn't the only thing at stake.
The credibility and reputations of IS managers, IT vendors and
consultants also are at risk.</font><p>

Thanks to the year 2000, corporate executives are wondering if
their trust in technical experts was warranted all along. It's finally
dawning on the top brass that their computer managershaven't properly
maintained their companies' software assets, even though the
millennium problem was foreseeable. CEOs have resolved to never again
be forced to spend money on something that prudent IS managers could
have avoided. No more surprises, please!<p>

<h3>The Next Nasty Surprise</h3>

Guess what? It's with a canny sense of journalistic timing that
the influential Gartner Group shone a spotlight on what will become
the computer topic of 1997: the total annual cost of ownership of
network computers and PCs.<p>

Although the details remain fuzzy about which costs are included
and how much of those will be real and how much will be virtual two
simple messages captured the CEOs' attention:<p>

Stripped-down versions of PCs (now called network computers just to
make a distinction that carries a minimal distinction) are as much as
41% less expensive than the PCs the company just installed after much
intraorganizational strife.<p>

If an organization doesn't want to buy network computers, it can still
realize savings of up to 26% just by managing its installed base of
PCs better.<p>

It's the second message that gets a good hearing from CEOs. A few
simple calculations show that, using one of Gartner's lesser
estimates, the savings could amount to $2,860 per PC per year. <p>

If you consider that networked computers in U.S. companies and
public-sector organizations will total an estimated 65 million to 75
million by the end of next year, the savings add up to a hefty $200
billion. <p>

The Gartner estimate is reasonable. I've found such opportunities to
save money in companies wherever seasoned computer professionals have
given up the custody of the PC playgrounds to enthusiastic office
amateurs.<p>

That raises an inevitable question: Why haven't the computer managers
found a way to avoid such excessive spending on PCs to begin with? A
saving isn't a saving if it eliminates something that could have been
avoided. One doesn't save money by stopping foolishness.<p>

The business world is sure to ask this $200 billion question; it's too
large a sum to ignore. Add it to the cost of fixing the year 2000
problem if you assume it will cost only $300 billion and you get about
$513 billion, equal to the pretax 1995 profits for the 2,992 U.S.
corporations in my database. That accounts for about 87% of the U.S.
gross domestic product. <p>

And $200 billion per year also would pay for almost all the annual
software development and maintenance costs last year. The idea of
cutting avoidable costs is clearly one whose time has come. But will
that be the only topic on the top executives' agenda?<p>

<h3>A Matter Of Trust</h3>

The era of exuberant business spending for computers soon will come to
an end marked by an eruption of distrust in the ability of IS
organizations to manage IT. In hindsight, the one-time $300 billion
year 2000 glitch and the $200 billion estimated annual PC overspending
will be used to dramatize the chronic abdication of top management
responsibilities to technical experts and consultants.<p>

Executives also will start to wonder what may show up next. Can they
trust the counsel that advised them to move from mainframes to PCs,
from PCs to client/server, from client/server to Internet, from
Internet to intranet to outsourcing, and now back to
mainframes-in-disguise as network computer controllers?<p>

The intoxicating computer-guzzling party is coming to a climax. Top
managers still treat information as an unavoidable expense and hate
any costly, avoidable surprises. The emerging sense of distrust will
begin in the U.S. and spread worldwide. CIOs, consultants and vendors
will be equally affected. CIO turnover, already excessive, will
accelerate. Consultants may have to offer insurance coverage or
performance bonds to get new business.<p>

This distrust won't diminish the role of computers in society. But it
will sober up executives who have become inebriated with
technocompulsions during 50 years of unjustified squandering of a
valuable tool. It will augur a discernible shift in expectations from
hopeful promises to demonstrable results. There will be little
tolerance for any IS executive who wastes money to fix avoidable
problems.<p>
