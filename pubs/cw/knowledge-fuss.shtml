<font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">hy are management gurus and IT
folks turning knowledge management into the latest launching pad for
boosting careers, pitching software and selling conferences? There are
reasons for every trend, and the reasons for this one are clear. Just
follow the money.</font>

<P> 

<P><B>Money Clue No. 1:</B> The exuberant stock market. We are living
during the largest stock market price bubble in history. According to
my calculations, at the end of last year, the total stock valuation of
6,153 U.S. firms was $13.7 trillion. Because the median financial
capital worth (e.g., book assets) of the top-ranking 25% of
corporations accounts for only 14% of their market worth, the
remaining 86% must be rationalized somehow. "Knowledge capital" offers
a handy answer. To keep those stock valuations rising indefinitely,
the experts recommend the art of managing knowledge. For a fee,
consultants will happily help firms boost their knowledge assets. Some
say knowledge management could increase the Dow Jones industrial
average tenfold and make Bill Gates the first trillionaire -- just
check out the September issue of Wired magazine or the popular recent
book entitled Dow 100,000: Fact or Fiction?

<P> <P><B>Money Clue No. 2:</B> The rediscovery of data management.
For all practical purposes, there are hardly any profits left in
selling PCs. Enterprise resource planning rescue missions have become
economic liabilities. So what can computer vendors do? They'd love to
launch the next trillion-dollar wave of new systems. But the problem
is that CEOs haven't gotten over the lack of verifiable evidence that
the last IT investment cycles boosted profits or delivered on promised
gains.

<P> <P>Knowledge management to the rescue. Vendors know data
management has always been a CIO's job. Point-of-sale devices,
Internet visitations and e-commerce transactions are spewing data at
gigabyte-per-second rates. With knowledge management, proponents of
new spending can argue that making employees smarter is the next big
thing, and managing all that data naturally falls to the CIO.
Increasing a firm's intellectual assets is hard to argue against and
offers an attractive platform from which to refloat shelved projects.

<P> <P><B>Money Clue No. 3:</B> Attracting conference attendance.
Conference prices are an indicator of the perceived worth of a
newfangled topic. Conference organizers find it lucrative to promote
knowledge management to eager MBAs seeking the executive suite. Last
time I saw anything comparable was at the height of the re-engineering
craze. So I was intrigued to see that "nuke them" re-engineering guru
Michael Hammer -- who once called for eliminating middle managers
despite the knowledge they've accumulated -- is holding knowledge
management conferences. A two-day seminar costs $2,400, or about $300
per hour per person. These prices and the "if it costs that much, it
must be worth it" mentality that justifies them also legitimize
knowledge management.<p>

<h3>Management implications</h3>

 Knowledge management has always been one of the principal managerial
tasks. Peter Drucker said so 40 years ago, and that won't change even
after current buzzwords are superseded by the next catchphrases. The
capacity to generate knowledge capital has always been a means of
achieving success. I have demonstrated why knowledge capital is more
profitable than financial capital (<a

Unfortunately, what passes for knowledge management applications
invariably calls for overlaying short-lived technologies on top of the
existing software junkyard.  That is unlikely to produce lasting
value.

<P> <P>Before you are swayed by the vendors and the hawkers, keep your
sense of balance about such investments; don't be easily swayed.
Insist that any "knowledge management" system produce verifiable gains
in your company's earning capacity. That's the only way to distinguish
between a passing utopia and the capacity to deliver increased
economic value.
