How can Microsoft keep growing at current rates? There's only one
way: It must change its business model and enter the IS services
industry. Soon, Microsoft will want to manage your desktop, not just
provide it with software.<p>

Microsoft's stock price is likely to sag if the company doesn't
maintain its growth rate. That will take some doing. To maintain its
1996-97 financial performance over the next 10 years, Microsoft's
profits must grow a total of 9,100% to $170 billion by 2007.
Meanwhile, growth in global IT spending is expected to remain at 9%
per year, compounded annually. Most of that growth will be in staff
and services, not packaged software, in which Microsoft is
dominant.<p>

Microsoft can't keep up its growth rate just by selling more
desktop software worldwide. Only 10 countries account for 85% of
worldwide IT spending, and that isn't likely to change materially. In
most of those countries, particularly the U.S., year 2000-problem
budget pressures and the creation of centrally controlled corporate
networks will reduce the amount of money opportunity for desktop
software. There's less growth available to Microsoft in this business
than in the past few years.<p>

What about raising the price of Windows NT? New editions are projected
to cost twice as much as the entry-level versions. Nevertheless, at
most, NT can only double Microsoft's share of the total cost of
ownership from the present $180 per seat per year to $360. That isn't
enough to maintain current growth, even if Microsoft's software were
to control most of the clients and servers in the universe.<p>

So far, Microsoft's accomplishments in entertainment and publishing
aren't impressive. After investing hundreds of millions of dollars in
ventures such as The Microsoft Network, children's software and the
Expedia Travel Service, those product lines still don't contribute
much to the company's profits. The payback from Microsoft's $1 billion
investment in cable operator Comcast and $425 million for WebTV
technology is very much in doubt.<p>

One bellwether moneymaker for Microsoft is offering around-the-clock
online support at a flat rate of $35 per problem. To keep its costs
down, Microsoft has subcontracted much of its online assistance to
firms in states with low labor costs. That's a good business for
Microsoft, because corporate staffs won't be able to match Microsoft's
superior expertise, which comes from linking its marketing, service
and development organizations. But getting a piece of the desktop
support business isn't enough to drive growth. It's worth only about
$120 per seat per year.<p>

<h3>Microsoft's best bet</h3>

The most lucrative approach left for growing revenue and profits is
desktop and network management services. Recently announced and widely
publicized, Microsoft's Zero Administration Initiative and
IntelliMirror features are an attempt to cash in as companies try to
cut desktop costs.<p>

Managing corporate desktops and networks is a lucrative business for
Microsoft. The company could offer to eliminate more than half of its
clients' unnecessary ownership costs through remotely executed
diagnostics, preventive online maintenance, asset controls and
fault-monitoring techniques. For some clients, the savings could be
worth as much as $4,000 per seat per year. Microsoft could then
collect a large share of those savings by real-time metering and
cyberbilling of chunks of Microsoft software needed to complete any
business transaction.<p>

That's a hard strategy to execute. To carry it out, customers must
institute tight network rules, install uniform desktop operating
systems and enforce standards - all dictated by Microsoft. All
corporate applications would become inextricably dependent on
Microsoft.<p>

Still, this omniscient, universal solution may be just what executives
are looking for. CEOs and CIOs are anxious to regain control of their
systems and integrate them; many companies are already taking steps to
implement such a centralized approach. Executives will be attracted to
Microsoft's centrist and disciplined view of how to manage information
if it enables them to eliminate the chaos of their homegrown systems.
Bill Gates' superb marketing engine will surely claim that Microsoft
offers the only feasible way to achieve universal connectivity and
enterprisewide interoperability. Only a market-dominant firm,
operating under unified leadership and possessing global capabilities,
can deliver that capability, they will say.<p>

<h3>A historian's admonition</h3>

Yet if history teaches anything, it's that universal and monolithic
solutions, when imposed by a dominant authority, will ultimately fail.
Corruption, rigidity, accidents or arrogance will always creep in.
CIOs should be suspicious of any Microsoft claim to offer an
all-encompassing solution, regardless of the immediate benefits it may
offer. Nobody can predict if Microsoft can succeed where others have
failed. Microsoft's quest for dominance is yet to be tested as
information management evolves from an era driven by desktops to one
propelled by network-centric communications.<p>

My advice is exactly what I give to anyone who buys a home or enters
into an outsourcing contract: After you move in, how costly will it be
to move out? Corporate executives have finally learned that IT
spending isn't merely an annual expense but a lasting and costly
commitment. Questions will be asked about the ultimate costs of
overdependency on a single and powerful vendor. Computer executives
who are tempted to put all their faith in Microsoft ought to be ready
to answer to that.<P>

Strassmann (<a
href="mailto:paul@strassmann.com">paul@strassmann.com</a>) has spent
lots of money since 1961 converting information systems from one
generation of technology to another. Much of that was avoidable
through tight control of data and disciplined systems engineering to
avoid dependency on any one vendor's products and services.
