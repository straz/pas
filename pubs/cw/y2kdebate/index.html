much will it cost to fix the year 2000 problem? Probably less than we've
been hearing, wrote Paul A. Strassmann in his <I>Computerworld</I>
 <A HREF="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/y2kdata.shtml">column</A>
on May 18. Strassmann used first-quarter 1998 filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to estimate that companies are budgeting only $50
billion to fix year 2000 troubles - a surprisingly low 8.3% of their annual
information technology budgets. That column triggered an E-mail debate
among other millennium experts, Leon A. Kappelman, Capers Jones and fellow
columnist Ed Yourdon, who say the cost of fixing the problem will be much
higher than Strassmann's projections. What follows is a virtual roundtable
discussion on the subject:<BR>

(University of North Texas and SIM Year 2000 Working Group): I find some
of Strassmann's conclusions troubling. In a nutshell, the SEC data is weak
due to off-Y2K-budget items (for example, upgrades, replacements) and underreporting
errors (85% of corporations think their year 2000 estimates are too low
[<I>Newsweek</I>, May 18]). As the Society of Information Management's
Year 2000 Working Group points out in our new <A HREF="http://www.year2000.unt.edu/index.htm#paper2" target="NEW">white
paper</A>, there is often an enormous disconnect between upper management
(those who approve SEC paperwork) and the people running Y2K projects (those
who answer the SIM study questionnaires). From what I've seen about these
projects, I'd place my money on the project managers. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">And these project
leaders tell us that their enterprises are spending about 38% of one year's
IT operating budget dealing with their Y2K problems - and that that number
only marginally includes embedded systems and desktop/PC problems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, sans serif">Strassmann</FONT></B><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">:
Before you place your trust in project managers, you need to be convinced
that they have no conflict of interest in reporting higher year 2000 costs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, sans serif">Kappelman</FONT></B><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">:
Just like management may have a bias for reporting a lower one. The truth
is somewhere in between, perhaps? Seems that both samples pose validity
challenges.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="strassmann.gif" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100 ALIGN=RIGHT> </FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, sans serif">Strassmann</FONT></B><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">:
Arguing that &quot;the truth is somewhere in between&quot; does not recognize
that the biases do not have equal validity. When I weigh the biases of
project managers reporting to SIM and management reporting to the SEC,
all I can say is that management may be held accountable for what they
say. It becomes a matter of record and subject to litigation and liability
suits. Project managers filling out SIM questionnaires cannot and would
not ever be held accountable for what they say. Furthermore, the project
managers claims remain anonymous, while SEC filings are on the public record
and signed by a CFO.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, sans serif">Kappelman</FONT></B><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">:
Agreed. Permit me to clarify: I didn't imply they were equal, else I would
have said &quot;in the middle&quot; rather than &quot;in between.&quot;
Still, the decision of what one enterprise includes as a Y2K budget may
be very different from the choice of another. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">In light of no
standardized definitions for things such as &quot;Y2K compliance&quot;
or &quot;Y2K expense&quot; and what I think is management's bias toward
underreporting this figure, I suspect the SEC figures are on the low end
of the scale.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, sans serif">Capers Jones</FONT></B><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">
(chairman, Software Productivity Research): I've been studying estimating
accuracy for more than 20 years. For large software project estimates,
these are the approximate results from among our clients: Out of every
100 estimates, about 70 will be extremely optimistic, 25 will be within
plus or minus 10%, and 5 will be conservative by more than 10%. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Since optimism
and underestimates are the norm for software, and since year 2000 estimates
are more complicated than normal software estimates, I suspect the SEC
reports may be optimistic. What often happens is that the project manager
initially creates an accurate or conservative estimate. When it is presented
to senior management or clients, the conservative estimate is rejected
and arbitrarily replaced by a more aggressive estimate and schedule. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Ultimately we have
to get down to numbers. Is it $300 billion-plus as alleged by Gartner Group,
or is it closer to $50 billion for U.S. corporate accounts? </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">My estimate for
overall U.S. costs prior to the Y2K event is for $177 billion since I also
included hardware upgrades, database repairs and other costs outside of
software. I estimate that another $497 billion was for post-2000 litigation,
damages and recovery. These are not in the SEC data, I suspect.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="yourdon.gif" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100 ALIGN=RIGHT> </FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, sans serif">Ed
Yourdon</FONT></B><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"> (chairman, Cutter
Consortium): Strassmann's information is interesting, but among other things
it assumes that companies are reporting accurate data to the SEC. I've
heard from a fairly reliable source that at least one very large New York
bank is spending five times as much on Y2K as it's reporting, in order
to disguise the magnitude of its problem and to avoid scaring people. Also,
the language in the SEC disclosures was often so ambiguous that it was
difficult, if not impossible, to tell what companies were really doing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, sans serif">Strassmann</FONT></B><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">:
If we had lots of cheaters, the regression analysis would have shown it.
To my surprise, this was not so - the relationship between the numbers
reported to the SEC and my approximation of the IT budget was a relatively
tight fit. To get such a result would require 85 SEC filers to uniformly
share an identical underreporting bias. The probability of that happening
is hard to conceive. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>As I noted in my
<I>Computerworld</I> <A HREF="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/y2kdata.shtml">column</A>,
while the SEC numbers have greater credibility than anything published
so far, I do not feel we should depend entirely on the SEC data until we
see a larger sample from companies that have passed through the testing
phases of Y2K remediation. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>As noted by Machiavelli:
Always assume incompetence before looking for conspiracy.<BR>
