            <P></P>
            <P>Paul Strassmann is playing his favourite role once more: the 
            computer expert who claims companies are wasting money on computers. 
            </P>
            <P>The information technology industry's leading iconoclast has been 
            rehearsing the part during more than 40 years of rigorous research 
            into companies and their use of IT. However, as the latest* of his 
            more than 200 reports, books and articles on the subject nears 
            publication, his message has been refined into its ultimate, 
            devastating form. </P>
            <P>Mr Strassmann's central thesis is that no relationship can be 
            demonstrated between the amount a company spends on computer systems 
            and its profitability. And, he believes, none ever will be. </P>
            <P>He quotes for emphasis Robert Solow, the Nobel Prize-winning 
            economist, who taught him statistics at Massachusetts Institute of 
            Technology: "You can see computers everywhere - except in economic 
            statistics." </P>
            <P>A second argument is no less contentious: that the IT industry, 
            customers and vendors alike, is on the cusp of an important - and 
            final - disjunction: "Every seven years, we have torn up what has 
            gone before and started again," he says. "There have been eight 
            cycles of 'build and scrap' since 1946. The first cost $100m, equal 
            to 7 per cent of business investment at the time. The last cost 
            $2,000bn, or 47 per cent. The next would have cost $5,000bn but we 
            have run out of money: we have come to the end of history as we know 
            it." </P>
            <P>These conclusions have a significance beyond the computer 
            industry. The US, which spends more on IT than any other nation, is 
            on the brink of its first recession in a decade, dragging with it 
            much of the developed world. It has sustained growth during the past 
            10 years, many think, by investing in information systems. The 
            pundits argue that this has delivered competitive gains, accelerated 
            transactions and increased customer satisfaction. Many other 
            nations, envious of the performance of the US economy in the past 
            decade, have set out to achieve the same miracle. </P>
            <P>But is this belief in IT as the powerhouse of improved 
            productivity misplaced? Has the US's share of that $2,000bn been 
            squandered on a false promise? </P>
            <P>Few are better placed to answer these questions than Mr 
            Strassmann, now 72 and as active in retirement as when he was chief 
            information officer for the US Department of Defence. </P>
            <P>His career has seen him managing the information interests of 
            large companies, including Kraft and Xerox. It culminated in his 
            appointment to a newly created post of director of defence 
            information at the Department of Defence, where he was responsible 
            for a $35bn cost-reduction programme. He oversaw the DoD IT strategy 
            at the time of the Gulf war and was rewarded with the Defence Medal 
            for Distinguished Public Service, its highest civilian award. </P>
            <P>It is, however, the quality and quantity of the data underpinning 
            his chief contentions that set Mr Strassmann apart. He has been 
            collecting financial statistics on the world's principal companies 
            with all the enthusiasm of a trainspotter since 1954, soon after 
            leaving Cooper Union college in New York City with an engineering 
            degree. </P>
            <P>Today, the numbers - revenue, profits, assets, productivity, head 
            count and so on - fill appendix after appendix in his published 
            works. He is contemptuous of the profusion of studies from 
            consultancies and the computer industry "proving" the value of 
            investment in computer systems: "I give little credence to the 
            gloss. I say: 'Show me the numbers,'" he declares with a grin. Not 
            for Mr Strassmann the superficial "150 leading companies" that 
            contribute to most surveys. His latest work, on European 
            competitiveness, analyses in depth more than 3,000 companies. </P>
            <P>The question of how investment in computers may be linked to 
            profitability is as intriguing as it is difficult to answer, in 
            spite of intensive efforts during the past half-century. </P>
            <P>Mr Strassmann believes his numbers indicate unequivocally that 
            there is no connection between investment in computers and 
            profitability. He has looked at the data in every possible way. 
            Plot, for example, investment in IT per employee against return on 
            equity for several hundred companies in the US and Europe. If 
            greater IT investment led to increased profits, you would expect to 
            be able to plot a straight(ish) line climbing from left to right. 
            But Mr Strassmann's chart shows only a random scatter of points, 
            suggesting that IT spending has no bearing on profits. </P>
            <P>Mr Strassmann asserts: "Ingesting profuse quantities of the best 
            and latest IT may be largely irrelevant and possibly damaging if the 
            corporation already suffers from excess assets (too much fat) and a 
            huge administrative cost (clogged arteries) and chases every 
            marketing fad (schizophrenia)." </P>
            <P>IT spending, Mr Strassmann concludes, has an important but 
            chiefly catalytic role. This is not to argue that IT is worthless, 
            only that it is not an end in itself. Its role, he says, is to 
            promote the factors such as competitive advantage, strategic 
            positioning and management style and quality that do most to 
            determine profitability. </P>
            <P>A company that spends wisely - even if sparsely - on IT will see 
            its performance enhanced. A company that spends indiscriminately on 
            IT will see its performance diminished, because IT will merely 
            amplify its poor business practices. </P>
            <P>For evidence he cites the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies 
            (PIMS) programme, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which 
            concluded, using data from 3,000 client companies, that market 
            environment, competitive situation and position in the market made a 
            65 per cent contribution to profit-ability; operating effectiveness 
            contributed only 15 per cent. </P>
            <P>The fact remains that over the past 15 years or so US companies 
            have devoted a dramatically increasing proportion of their 
            investment dollars to IT. "I find the similarity between IT spending 
            and the arms race the most plausible explanation for what has been 
            corporate practice over the past decade," says Mr Strassman. </P>
            <P>He says IT budget reviews in many companies have followed the 
            military pattern, where requests for added funding are based on 
            little more than the need to match the capabilities of competitors: 
            "In this respect the job of the IT proponents is made easier since 
            vendors and an advertising-supported press will make sure the 
            accomplishments of the leading innovators in each industry are well 
            described and promoted." </P>
            <P>This IT arms race is no more about to end than the sales force is 
            about to pack away its powerpoint presentations. However, Mr 
            Strassmann believes that companies will no longer be able to afford 
            to escalate their IT spending according to the past pattern, where 
            each wave of investment has been bigger than the last. </P>
            <P>Because of this constraint, spending will remain stagnant. This 
            will delay the next chapter in the story - the move from IT based on 
            companies' own systems to IT based on central servers and the 
            network. </P>
            <P>This is a frightening scenario for vendors that are used to rapid 
            revenue growth. The answer, Mr Strassmann argues, is to escape the 
            inefficiencies inherent in today's customer-based IT : "a 
            do-it-yourself cottage mode of production and mediaeval guild 
            mentality". </P>
            <P>And the way to do this, he says, is for hardware and software 
            vendors to fund the next round of IT development, by supplying IT 
            services on a fee basis over the internet. In simple terms, IT will 
            be supplied through a conduit in the wall, like electricity, water 
            or gas. </P>
            <P>He believes that the first green shoots of this transformation in 
            the industry can be seen in the explosion of application service 
            providers (ASPs), companies that rent software over the internet for 
            a monthly rental fee. </P>
            <P>Many experts regard Mr Strassmann's predictions about ASPs with 
            almost as much suspicion as they view his ideas of productivity. 
            Companies, they say, will not trust ASPs with sensitive data or to 
            run complex systems. </P>
            <P>Mr Strassmann, however, rejects these objections: "The records of 
            most company-embedded IT shops are now sufficiently blemished that 
            management will certainly be inclined to listen to the enticing 
            promises of increasingly revenue-hungry IT vendor. </P>
            <P>So, not content with years of rubbishing vendors' claims about 
            the value of their wares, he is now predicting the demise of the 
            corporate IT department. A Czech by birth, Strassmann was a 
            resistance fighter during the second world war. It must have been 
            useful preparation for taking on the battalions of the IT industry.
