 <p>There is no correlation between investment in information technology
 and profitability. Although some companies achieve spectacular results
 through their use of IT systems, higher investment per employee does
 not result in higher return on equity.</p> 
 
 <p>This is the conclusion of
 research carried out over a number of years by Paul Strassmann, adjunct
 professor at the School of Information Warfare at the National Defense
 University in Washington and the Military Academy at West Point.</p> 
 
 <p>An associate of Butler Group, the analyst, he was previously
 director of defence information at the Pentagon and chief information
 officer at General Foods, Kraft and Xerox. Mr Strassmann started
 researching the relationship between strategic variables and
 profitability "out of sheer survival" in 1982, through the Strategic
 Planning Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p> 
 
 <p>"I had to be
 able to get up in front of not-always-friendly financial committees and
 explain why my budgets were growing faster than revenue or profits," he
 says.</p> 
 
 <p>"As the numbers got bigger, so the questions got much more
 pointed - and the explanations had to be increasingly of higher
 quality."</p> 
 
 <p>Mr Strassman's quickly learned to focus his
 justification on very specific corporate problems, rather than general
 benefits. Instead of using presentation slides, he walked in only with
 spreadsheets and cash-flow forecasts.</p> 
 
 <p>Mr Strassmann's research
 results have been published in a series of books since 1982 and have
 consistently shown that there is no correlation between IT investment
 and performance. His latest research is based on the accounts of 1,585
 companies in the US.</p> 
 
 <h3>Productivity growth</h3> 
 
 <p>The McKinsey
 Global Institute's recent report into productivity growth, which is
 based on government productivity measures, largely supports Mr
 Strassmann's findings.</p> 
 
 <p>"Spending on information technology was
 not based on the laws of economics, but was an arms race," he says.
 "People spent money regardless, because they believed that if they
 didn't they would fall behind competitively. It was driven entirely by
 panic that somebody would outsmart them. I don't blame chief technology
 officers alone, because the whole of management over-focused on
 IT."</p> 
 
 <p>Mr Strassmann focuses on the cost of moving a dollar's
 worth of merchandise out of the factory and into the hands of a
 consumer, which has been increasing. "All sorts of additional labour
 has been put into offices, shuffling paper and messing around with
 computers," he says.</p> 
 
 <p>In fact, the research shows that only 27
 per cent of costs in global IT budgets are for bought-in hardware,
 software and services. The other 73 per cent of costs are internal, but
 Mr Strassmann believes that this is going to change.</p>
 
 <p>"Corporations are finally fed up with IT and they cannot afford
 escalating costs any more," he says. "They always compensated for
 incompetence by spending more money, but we are out of money now."</p>
 
 <p>The solution is to move the IT into the hands of people who are
 competent to deliver the technology. This leaves the corporation to
 focus on the economics, rather than on the technology.</p> 
 
 <p>"We are
 done with technology," he says. "From now on, it's economics - and the
 role of the CIO is to make money. Technology has to be taken for
 granted. It must be available when you need it, how you need it,
 cheaply, reliably and securely. You have to worry about how to use it,
 not how to manage it."</p> 
 
 <p>Whereas IT costs are mostly fixed,
 outsourcing gives the corporation a known, predetermined variable cost
 per unit. Mr Strassmann sees the IT vendors changing their role.
 "Instead of being an arms supplier they are a mercenary," he says.
 "Every vendor, without exception, has announced their intent to pursue
 that direction, so the handwriting is on the wall."</p> 
 
 <h3>Increasing issues of security</h3> 
 
 <p>This move towards services and outsourcing is
 raising issues of security. The problem is that the vendors are
 creating major single points of failure. When an "information warfare"
 attack comes, it will be against all the vendor's customers, not just
 one company. This makes security and information warfare the dominant
 issue in the future development of IT.</p> 
 
 <p>Mr Strassmann was one of
 a small group of people who wrote the first ever policy on information
 warfare in 1992 "to the shock of everybody in the Pentagon". He now
 spends more than half his time teaching security and lecturing on
 information terrorism to senior government officials around the
 world.</p> 
 
 <p>"Nothing is secure any more," he says. "As a society, we
 will have to live with networks, databases, telecommunications, mobile
 devices and billions of computers and we will have to find ways of
 securing them. Management needs to start looking at security as part of
 the whole question of economics."</p> 
 
 <p>Information warfare has
 increased the risk premium used to set the discount rate in cash flow
 calculations for IT investment. This means that minimum return on
 investment (or "hurdle") rates will be higher, so costs will need to be
 tightly controlled and more benefits will need to be identified.</p>
 
 
 <p>"When the relationship between profits and IT is random, it doesn't
 mean you can't make money with IT," he concludes.</p> 
 
 <p>"Some
 companies, such as Wal-Mart (the US retailer), did spectacularly well
 and absolutely dominate their business and profitability because of
 very strategic and smart use of IT.</p> 
 
 <p>"You can make enormous
 amounts of money out of computers if you know what you are doing and if
 you are looking for payoff, rather than glory.</p> 
 
 <p>"From now on,
 just watch the economics and the risk, not the technology."</p>
