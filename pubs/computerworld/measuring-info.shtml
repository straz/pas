<font size="+2">A</font><font size="+1"> remarkable event took place
in New York on Feb. 2.  </font> The Microsoft-guided Information Work
Productivity Council convened an invitation-only forum to discuss
what's known about the contributions of information technologies to
productivity. Key executives from Accenture, Cisco, HP, Intel, SAP and
Xerox were listed as co-sponsors, but the tone was set by the keynote
delivered by the council's chairman, Jeff Raikes, Microsoft group vice
president.

<P>Raikes, who oversees business and productivity services at
Microsoft, kicked off the daylong meeting by talking about what it
would take to "reinvent" productivity. "Economics needs to find a
better way to reflect the new models of the Information Age," Raikes
said. "Instead of focusing on outputs, we need to focus on outcomes."

<P>Raikes framed the productivity issue in Microsoft terms, such as
how to demonstrate to skeptical financial executives the extent to
which instant messaging can make an organization more profitable, and
how you can get the funding you need by calculating the ROI of
deploying Tablet PC hardware.

<P>Despite references to 20 years of discussions about the
"productivity paradox," the speakers made it clear that the specter of
not knowing how to prove, in tangible terms, the relationship between
IT and enterprise-level economic results is still haunting the IT
industry. Their anxiety reminded me somehow of <i>The Emperor's New
Clothes</i> by Hans Christian Andersen. It was apparent that the
vendor ambassadors were walking around without much substantive cover
in the form of a way to prove -- in commonly accepted financial terms
-- that the customers' IT spending makes a verifiable contribution to
profits.

<P>We are now in an era when almost no applications of computers are
amenable to analysis by proven industrial engineering methods --
unlike in the days when computers were applied to automation of
clerical labor.

<P>Customer IT executives declare consistently that they have an
urgent need for new techniques to address the productivity gains of
workers whose observable output is hard to measure. The articulate
Raikes made that clear when he said that the goal of the council was
to "redefine productivity and create a framework for Information Age
economics. ... The current measures fail to measure the contributions
of IT."

<P>If we can overlook the council's self-serving purposes, its
objectives are commendable. Unfortunately, "The Information Work
Productivity Primer," which was distributed to the participants to
provide an explanation of the council's thinking, didn't offer
anything that could be used to win over skeptical CFOs. It defined the
issue and provided a review of theoretical work that would be useless
in preparing for an IT budget review. The primer and the talks didn't
offer vulnerable CIOs much hope that they could survive a grilling
from corporate budget analysts with the help of tools that someday
could become available from the council.

<P>The problem with the work of the council is its exclusive vendor
orientation. It's unlikely that credible solutions will come out of
its efforts until the vendors also include material participation from
CIOs and CFOs. Productivity and profits from the application of IT --
the outputs that Raikes talked about passionately -- are delivered by
customers and not by suppliers. It's the customer's IT executives who
must prove that their company's IT spending is productive and
profitable!

<P>The council must overcome its apparent assumption that the answers
to the productivity paradox can be found in researching high-level
government statistics and not in detailed data that reports on the
results of corporate profit centers. The plain fact is that all
aspects of business are based on what the accountants report as
corporate results. When corporate review committees examine IT
budgets, they will first translate funding requests into financial
impacts as measured by the accountants before they will listen to all
of the other promises.

<P><a name="a4090"></a>A more realistic view of how to measure
corporate information productivity, as seen from CIO and CFO points of
view, is already available to <i>Computerworld</i> readers. If you'd
like to explore how to perform such calculations for your
organization, as well as check whether your company was ranked among
the global 1,319 firms in my information productivity index, have a
look at the report <a

target="new">"Defining and Measuring Information Productivity"</a>. A
comparison of where your company stands in productivity relative to
its competitors could be your best opener when asking for IT money.
