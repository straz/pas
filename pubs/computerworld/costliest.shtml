<font size=+6>T</font><font size=+1>he price of "low-cost computing"
has gotten very high: Distributed computing has become the largest single
item in every company's computer budget.</font><p>


If there's good news in this, it's that the money needed for year 2000
remedies and bailing out failed client/server projects can be squeezed
out of bloated total cost of ownership (TCO) figures. The problem is
knowing where most of the fat is hidden.<P>

Here's where to start: Find the most expensive users. By analyzing how
much money is spent to meet the needs of different kinds of users, we
can find the fat.<P>

Banks make the best laboratory subjects for examining TCO. They
closely monitor IT costs, and nearly all bank workers are information
workers. And, banks spend about half their IT budgets on distributed
computing.<P>

I have reliable numbers of total IT spending last year by 13 U.S.
commercial banks. Those banks rank among the top IT spenders. Their
total IT budgets now average 25% of what they pay out to their
employees as compensation, consume 13% of noninterest costs (overhead)
and eat up one-third of the total profits the banks earn. With all
that spending, there's certainly room for reducing total ownership
costs.<P>

<h3>Direct and indirect costs</h3>

I looked at both Direct Budgeted Costs (DBC) and Indirect User Costs
(IUC), which together make up the total cost of ownership. Banks
define DBCs as their IT spending. IT includes the costs of hardware,
software, telecommunications, systems development, systems maintenance
and computer operations. IUCs represent the time users spend on chores
that the IT organization can't or won't deliver, such as rebooting a
crashed desktop, waiting for the help desk to answer a request and
then waiting for someone to fix the problem, or trying to fix a
problem without anyone's assistance.<P>

I have found that the per-employee DBC -- the visible component of TCO
-- is related to employee compensation. Low-paid tellers will work
with terminals whose DBC is perhaps as little as $2,000 per year. The
most-often quoted benchmarks are based on an average employee salary
of $32,000 per year and show up as having DBCs from $4,500 to $6,000.
Investment analysts, currency traders and top techies would consider
it a blow to their status if they had to use anything but the biggest
and best. That can run up the DBC to between $12,000 and $15,000
because the equipment consumes large amounts of unproductive labor.<P>

Most of the excessive total cost of ownership figures can be found
among those users who will be the most vocal in defending their unique
computer configurations. I have found cases where it's much less
expensive to give such a complainer two computers: one to experiment
with and another that conforms to corporate standards. After all, the
cost of hardware is now less than 35 cents per hour, which is a small
fraction of the nuisance one can create by tying up support staff that
costs $40 per hour.<P>

Then there are the IUCs. Employees waste time coping with avoidable
mishaps. They also lose productivity because they take time to do work
for which they aren't qualified. The IUCs are, therefore, related to
the employee's compensation and the failure of the computing
infrastructure to eliminate avoidable disruptions.<P>

The IUC for a low-reliability network used by highly paid
professionals can run as high as $11,000. In contrast, a
high-reliability network can have an IUC as low as $1,400. Cutting
back on unproductive downtime, for whatever cause, can be the source
of enormous savings.<P>

<h3>Implications for executives</h3>

I believe most companies have costly users, their own equivalent of
those banks' investment analysts and traders. But how fast one can
slim down high TCO depends on how quickly the executives responsible
for IT can halt the profligate practices that have grown along with
the distribution of computing power. Most of this can be achieved by
shifting much of the labor-intensive support costs to sophisticated
network controls. That requires standardization of operating practices
while finding solutions that don't interfere with personal privacy and
individuals' freedom to use the computer for knowledge enhancement.<P>

It may take a change in management to accomplish that. (About 40% of
CIO turnover is a harbinger of things to come; see CW, Nov. 10.) But
the smart operators won't wait. CIOs can't hide the real costs of
computing much longer. Profits have been good recently and interest
rates low, but if that changes, cutting total cost of ownership will
be high on everybody's list. For the 13 banks, we're talking about
reducing the TCO for 291,000 PCs. That's $1.5 billion per year. It
will surely get attention as soon as top management figures out what
TCO is all about.<P>

The time has come to start extracting savings from excessive total
cost of ownership before one is mandated to do so under duress that
involves a hasty transition. A CIO must act now to cut the excess from
TCO or be forced to do it later -- and have to hunt for a new job at
the same time.<p>

cutting avoidable operating costs before requesting funds for 
worthwhile new investments in information management.</font>
