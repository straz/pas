<font size="+2">A</font><font size="+1">s Xerox's stock plunged last
month,</font> the search for a culprit was on.  The Wall Street
Journal, for one, pointed an accusing finger at the company's
inability to invoice customers correctly. Why would Xerox - one of the
most respected U.S. corporations and an acknowledged IT leader - be
injured by something so routine?<P>

The answer can be found in understanding a sequence of leadership
misjudgments. A few pivotal events can irreversibly deflect an
enterprise toward its rise or demise. <P>

The fate of Xerox can be traced back to 1983, when conflicts between
its computer-oriented innovators and xerography-focused sales force
were settled by dooming the inventions from the company's Palo Alto
Research Center to being technological marvels without competent
marketing to sell them. Shortly thereafter, Xerox management crippled
itself from participating in the information races altogether by
taking much of its cash and investing it in "safer" business lines
such as insurance.<P>

After that, it was only a matter of time before most of Xerox's elite
IT organization would be tagged as being dispensable and outside the
firm's core competencies. It was an easy way to cut the bloated
overhead of a company whose profits were sputtering. <P>

In 1994, Xerox entered into an outsourcing agreement with Electronic
Data Systems Corp. Initially, it transferred to EDS about 2,000 people
who were running demonstrably efficient operations, keeping only a
staff of fewer than 400, mostly planners. CIO Patricia Wallington
hailed the deal, saying, "Xerox didn't outsource to replace a failing
IT department or simply to save money. The $3.2 billion deal with EDS
enables IT to focus on new systems and strategies." Thus, Xerox handed
over the responsibility for running "as-is" mainframe systems, legacy
software (such as critical billing and sales-commission systems) and
telecommunications and for supporting PCs.<P>

It was a bad deal for Xerox. Trusted talent, necessary to innovate
amid rapidly changing competitive conditions, left the company. EDS
now owned the talent farm that had nurtured star performers. And the
culture of the conservative and highly regulated EDS people conflicted
with the liberal and improvising Xeroids, who were pushed to reduce
overhead. <P>

It was also a bad deal for EDS. Taking over operations where there was
little fat didn't leave much room for profit gains. To deliver
attractive financial results, EDS had to rely on standardization of
technology and greater uniformity of services. <P>

To attain economies of scale, EDS adopted a more rigid fixed-cost
model to extract profits. The goal was to grow volume at little extra
expense to produce superior profit margins. That didn't happen. The
Xeroids were adept at taking over IT functions in turf conflicts with
EDS over the most potentially lucrative sources of added profit for
EDS.<P>

The stage was then set for the drama that's now being reported only as
a recent technical and organizational snafu. <P>

In late 1998, Xerox stopped honoring bills from EDS. EDS had to write
off $200 million - almost half of its 1998 profits - attributing it
largely to "billing disputes" with Xerox. In February of last year,
EDS filed a multi-hundred million dollar lawsuit against Xerox. When Xerox
reorganized its sales and marketing operations later that year, the
billing system fell into disarray, and the sales force's efforts were
diverted to administrative chores instead of selling.<P>

<h3>Management Implications</h3>

The keys to information superiority are applications and how they can
help meet new competitive challenges as the business adapts to rapidly
changing conditions. Therefore, it's fatal to rigidly partition IT
between infrastructure and innovation. That's further aggravated if an
outsourcing deal forms a contractual barrier between legacy system
operations and innovations. In the deal with EDS, Xerox disabled the
need for continuity between the past and the future, and it paid
dearly. <P>
