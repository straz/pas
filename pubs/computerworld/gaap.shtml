<font size="+2">O</font><font size="+1">n Jan. 1, 1999, a new set of accounting rules</font>
 governing systems development and software assets took effect. CIOs,
software vendors and Washington bureaucrats will love the financial
tricks it enables. But these rules will also expose the financial
drain caused by inefficient and ineffective IT departments. All
financial reports from public corporations must comply with the
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) from the American
Institute of Certified PublicAccountants. The new ruling, known as SOP
98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use," requires:

<ul>
<P><li>Purchased off-the-shelf software, systems development and
systems integration costs must be treated as assets and capitalized.

<P><li>Planning, operations and implementation costs for all
internally developed software may be expensed as a current operating
cost and need not be capitalized ("Holding IT Accountable," Business,
Oct. 18).
</ul>

<P>Software vendors love GAAP's new rules. A $10,000 software license
shows up as only $2,000 or $2,500 (assuming five- or four-year
depreciation) in the customer's current-year IT budget. It sets up a
cycle of planned obsolescence: When the accountants have fully
depreciated the software's book value, it's time to buy the new model!

<P>CIOs will love these rules, too. Because software shows up only as
a depreciation line in the budget, they will be able to show an
immediate cut in IT costs and claim improved efficiencies. GAAP will
make conventional (and faulty) reporting metrics, such as IT spending
as a percentage of revenue, look better. Software investments now
account for 30% of the total IT budget. The costs of keeping faulty
software operating consume another 24% for maintenance and support,
migration of existing systems and personnel retraining. The change in
accounting rules will enable CIOs to defer up to half of their
reported IT expenses for successors to explain.

<P>Corporate management will also snap up GAAP. The transfer of any
costs from this year's financial statement to the balance sheet will
improve reported profits and please the stock market analysts. Plus,
the new rules are sufficiently ambiguous to let imaginative recording
of assets match the expected earnings.

<P>Washington already loves GAAP. By reclassifying software as an
asset, the new rules enabled the Clinton administration to count
software sales as an addition to the economic wealth of the U.S. That
enabled the feds to revise upward this year's gross domestic product
-- great news that's sure to set the stage for election-year boasting
and taking care of high-tech lobbies that advocate tax credits to
boost software sales.

<P>But if GAAP's new rules are so wonderful, why worry? The problem is
that they make CIOs much more accountable. When you set up software as
a depreciable asset, you must account for the useful life of those
investments to construct a defensible amortization schedule. If IT
executives have spent $1 trillion to install client/ server
infrastructures, why do you need another $2 trillion to replace them
with Web-based e-commerce? (Folks, those are the numbers!)<p>

If you spent $300 billion fixing Y2K, why do you need $150 billion to
replace failing "windowing" and "encapsulation" patches? The new
standard will impose demanding reporting requirements on corporate IT.
That will increase administrative costs and squabbling at the highest
corporate levels. What will CEOs and chief financial officers say as
they discover that for every 30 cents invested in new software, the IT
department spends 24 cents to keep applications alive?

<P>Compliance with the new regulations will mortally wound many
corporate IT departments. As a result, the economic viability of these
organizations will be subverted by emerging application services that
will be able to depreciate their software assets over a large
installed base. Software asset accounting will determine whether
obtaining computing power from networked computer utilities is more
advantageous than retaining large, in-house systems development shops.

Strassmann (<a

up and operated a large computer utility for delivering inexpensive
computing power. It fell short of its promise because software
economics weren't as favorable to networked support as they are today.
