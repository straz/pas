<font size="+2">F</font><font size="+1">or years, J.P. Morgan was the
most intensive private-sector user of IT.</font> It was spending more than
$75,000 on IT per employee, or almost 40% of what it spent on
salaries.  Given that J.P. Morgan has that much computing power, I was
surprised to hear that this venerable firm - the onetime lead banker
of American industrialization, the firm that saved the U.S. Treasury
from default in 1895 - would cease being independent and would merge
with Chase Manhattan. What really got my attention was the fact that
much of Morgan's IT was outsourced beginning in 1996, whereas Chase's
culture values IT as a homegrown competitive advantage.<p>

<P>How well has that outsourcing - a seven-year, $2.1 billion deal to
a consortium led by Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) - served Morgan?
Let's look at the ratio of operating expenses to revenue. Operating
expenses, reported as "noninterest costs," include such costs as
administrative overhead, IT expenditures, outsourcing costs,
consultants and depreciation. <p>

<P>As the chart shows, there was an alarming growth in the ratio from
1990 to 1994. Management became concerned and was looking to cut
costs. Meanwhile, rapidly mounting IT costs reached the unprecedented
level of more than 30% of operating expenses.<p>

<center><img src="dealgonebad.gif" alt="Operating Expenses/Revenue" height=339 width=486></center>

<P>So Morgan called in some big-name consultants, who told executives
that their hodgepodge of unintegrated systems could be best tamed by
outsourcing IT to a consortium of firms that would be expected to work
together. In due course, a four-company alliance led by CSC landed the
job.<p>

<P>This landmark deal was heralded with publicity comparable to what I
have heard in every failed outsourcing situation where the real motive
was cutting costs: "The real impetus for the project is to help
[Morgan] to retain its technology edge, to deliver better services to
end users and to free up internal resources to build new
applications."<p>

<P>Sure!<p>

<P>What really happened will always be a matter of conjecture, but the
operating expense-to-revenue ratio didn't budge. Instead, two years
later, it shot up to unprecedented levels. <p>

<P>My calculations show that even though Morgan's IT per-capita costs
were astronomical by any standard, there was no way to restore the
critical financial ratio to its prior levels by merely outsourcing
one-third of the IT budget. Confusing the matter further, the only
published claim of savings by the outsourcers was a $28 million cut in
IT costs in the contract's first year, only 0.6% of operating
expenses. <p>

<P>The much-hoped-for infusion of advanced technologies from the
outsourcing consortium didn't materialize, evidenced by the fact that
Morgan proceeded to hand over to the Bank of New York its investment
management accounting systems for Europe, which was a core competency
application.<p>

<P>Integration didn't happen, either. For example, IT and
telecommunications operations are run by the U.S. outsourcers, but not
in Japan, where J.P. Morgan has partnered with IBM.<p>

<P>I don't know how Morgan's IT operations will fare after merging
with Chase. My tracking of Chase's performance shows that it has been
able to achieve reductions in the operating-expense-to-revenue ratio,
which is likely the direction it will take to justify some of the
price it paid for Morgan.<p>

<P>There's no rationale for a major bank to outsource much of its IT
except in unique situations. There are no economies of scale when you
deal with an IT budget of more than $3 billion, the consolidated IT
budget of the bank subsequent to the merger. Instead, there's only
organizational confusion when accountability and simple
command-and-control structures are easily compromised. <p>
