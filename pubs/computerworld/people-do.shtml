<h2>Computers Don't Make Money, People Do</h2>

<font size="+1">Yes, computers add value, but give the skeptics their
due. The relationship between computer expenditures and corporate
performance is neither simple nor direct.</font><p>

The magical incantations that computers deliver competitive gains, speed up
business transactions, increase customer satisfaction, deliver superior quality
and lead to improved profitability is repeated so often that they have become
generally accepted wisdom. How could US corporations otherwise keep up spending
more money on computers than on any other investment?<p>

There are a few skeptics who keep searching for solid evidence that computers
are indeed profitable. As a CIO for thirty-two years, I had to do that as I
presided over hundreds of millions of spending. Management insisted that I come
up with a proof that all of my expenditures resulted in improved financial
results.

<h3>Gathering of Evidence</h3>

While I was CIO at Xerox I was able to get reliable data about computer
budgets, business indicators and financial results for more than fifty
worldwide operating divisions. These units competed with identical products,
against identical competitors, in separate geographic regions. Yet, the
financial results for each operating unit varied a great deal even though their
computer budgets as well as computer technologies were quite similar. My 1974
analysis revealed that there was absolutely no relation between computer
budgets and profits. Information technology was important, but certainly not a
key to profitability as was claimed by many.<p>

After that experience I spent seven years gathering data from other firms to
see if they behaved as Xerox operating units. Finally, in 1985 I published a
scatter diagram that displayed profit performance for eighty four companies, as
related to their computer expenses. No apparent connection between computer
spending and financial results was discovered.<p>

By 1990 I assembled data from 292 enterprises while engaged in consulting work.
Subsequently I published a diagram showing a random scatter pattern between
computer budgets and returns-on-investment. Most computer people and quite a
few academicians did not know what to make of it because my results did not
confirm what was expected. One of the objections to my findings was that the
data were obtained as by-products of consulting practice and only troubled
firms would seek advice with their budgets. Others asserted that convincing
evidence about the benefits of computers would take longer to reveal itself.
Analysis based on data gathered in the 1980's was premature.<p>

<h3>A 1994 Look at Five Hundred Corporations</h3>

The following diagram reflects financial results and operating
statistics from mostly public sources for 1994. Included are US,
European and Canadian firms. After forty years of the computer era
these findings are certainly not &quot;premature.&quot; The data originate from
a statistically unbiased sample:<p>

<h3>There is No Correlation</h3>

After twenty years of research I have found that computers do indeed add a
great deal of value to well managed companies. But, computers are not an
unqualified blessing. Identical machines, with identical software will make
things worse if the enterprise is mismanaged. <p>

The proof of these assertions is that computer expenditures and corporate
profits show no correlation whatsoever. I can state also that it is unlikely
that any such relationship can be ever demonstrated. Computers are only a
catalysts. Business values are created by well organized, well motivated and
knowledgeable people who understand what to do with all of the information that
shows up on the computer screens. It would be too much to hope that such
phenomenon would be a universal characteristics of all businesses.<p>

<h3>Not a Simple Relationship</h3>

Computer people must recognize that the fortunes of a corporation are
entirely shaped by the 25% of the revenues that are consumed by the Management
in managing the enterprise, in coordination of suppliers and in influencing
customers. Computerization accounts for less than one tenth of that total cost.<p>

Therefore, it is absurd for a CEO, COO or CFO to demand that the CIO proves how
computer budgets relate to profits simply and directly. The best that
computerization can deliver is to make Management more effective. Until robots
end up running completely automated businesses, computerization and
profitability are doomed to remain random scatter diagrams.<p>
