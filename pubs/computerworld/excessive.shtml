<h2>Trumped-up Profits Do A Disservice</h2>

April 3, 1995<hr>

This week I have completed the tabulation of the detailed profitability and
productivity results for 1,000 U.S. industrial corporation for 1983-1993. The
average Return-on-Capital for this period was 9.44%, while the average
Cost-of-Capital was 12.04%. At no time during the eleven years did the average
Return-on-Capital exceed the Cost-of-Capital, which means that on the average
it would have been always profitable to invest money in any project that
yielded more than 12.04%.<p>
Now, averages never tell you the entire story. The single most profitable year
for the single most profitable industry was the 34.5%. It was the
Return-on-Capital enjoyed by the Entertainment industry in 1988, largely
reflecting temporary gains from casinos.<p>
Considering the rather unspectacular returns realized by U.S. corporations, it
was with a sense of excitement that I turned to this January's industry awards
for the most profitable Return-on-Investment from information technology. The
opportunity to uncover for Computerworld readers extraordinary new
opportunities was prompted by the ROI scores of the top six winners who
reported 145%, 248%, 496%, 578%, 5,028% and believe-it-or-not a 14,659% gain
from installing innovative computer applications!<p>
When you confront something that is four-hundred twenty times better than the
best you have ever seen, it pays to check the facts. However, the calculations
were impeccable. Dividing the total claimed cumulative benefits of $365 million
by an expenditure of only $2.49 million for technology purchases, systems
development, maintenance and operations gave the expected number exactly. <p>
Next I checked the costs of the winning application. $2.49 million bought a
system that allowed headquarters to review sales and inventory positions daily.
That allowed corporate staff to keep up listed prices and replenish fast moving
items, while lowering prices and inventory for slow moving items. For a
corporation with 2,350 stores spending only $2.49 million on improved sales and
inventory reporting looked like a reasonable bargain. <p>
This left me with the task of understanding the $365 million of benefits
explained as "reduced inventory, reduced operating costs and enhanced revenue."
In other words, the headquarters controllers - who certified the savings for
the award - acknowledged that daily sales and inventory reports made them $365
million smarter. <p>
This sort of reasoning reminds me of a story about the engineer who went to
Africa, contracted amebic dysentery and was laid up in a hospital for two
months, which cost $35,000. His replacement took with him a $49.95 water
filtration widget and completed the job. Upon return the second engineer
claimed that the water filtration widget was worth a  70,000% ROI.<p>
One cannot claim profitability from overcoming neglect that comes from not
doing what is right. The return on the water filtration widget is the
difference between its cost and the next alternative solution, such as drinking
only boiled water, soda, wine or beer. Similarly, if merchandising people do
not pay attention to sales and inventory levels, the return on the computer
investment is difference between improving management practices by the least
costly other means.<p>
Contests that trumpet astronomic ROI's are doing a great disservice to
information systems managers and the industry in general. They inflate
unwarranted expectations. They encourage laughable manipulations of numbers.
They diminish credibility. They devalue the merits of solid accomplishments.
After all, earning only 34.5% is something worth bragging about provided it is
legitimate, provable and risk-free.<p>
