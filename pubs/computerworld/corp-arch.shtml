<h2>Corporate Architecture Must Play Politics</h2>

Corporate and government bookshelves are filled with dust-covered
architectural plans conceived by task forces, consultants and vendors.
These are idealized technological concepts that do not link to the power
structure they are supposed to support. There can be no enterprise
architecture without a direct link to the balance of power.<p>

The authors of architectural documents that define only technologies
confuse form with substance. The architecture of how information can be
distributed must always be subordinated to decisions of who can use it.<p>

A technical IS architecture tells us how to build information systems. In
contrast, information politics tells us how a human organization already
built can be successful and adapt to future changes. These are not separate
but intertwined relationships.<p>

A technical IS architecture deals with connections among physical and
programmed elements. Information politics deals with interactions among
human beings.<p>

A technical IS architecture is typically imposed unilaterally and enforced
by technological means. Information politics, in the sense I am using it,
must reflect social consensus that is multilateral and negotiated.<p>

A technical IS architecture provides a framework for the capture, storage
and manipulation of data. Only governance can tell you how information
should be organized so that it can be converted into knowledge.
Implementation of a technical "architecture" should be made only after you
have established clear political governance. Politics always comes before
technology.<p>

Mainframe-dominated corporate information departments failed because they
tried to impose a well-reasoned technical architecture on an environment
that became increasingly varied. Customers demanded solutions that fit a
political need more than an economic rationale. That lesson should be
heeded by anyone commissioned to write yet another technical architecture
document.<p>

One of the basic principles of any information architecture should be a
strong bias for giving priority to processing external information before
processing internal information. Competitive forces are external whereas
bureaucratic forces are internal. Both forces are dangerous, except that
the external threats are swifter and must be dealt with first.<p>

The capacity to translate external signals into responses determines how
well an organization copes with external challenges. An information
architecture is one way for an organization to coordinate itself first for
survival and then for prosperity.<p>

There is no such thing as a standard enterprise architecture. It must be as
unique as a fingerprint because enterprises differ in how they function.
The adoption of an enterprise architecture is therefore one of the most
urgent tasks for top executive management . Fundamentally, an information
architecture is a political doctrine that specifies who will have what
types of information to make decisions. Never delegate the conception of an
architecture plan to computer experts because they will judge it only on
its technical merits.<p>
