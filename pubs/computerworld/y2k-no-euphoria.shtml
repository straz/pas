<font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">It's 10 a.m. on Jan. 1.  I've
been watching the status display</font> from the International Y2K
Cooperation Center (<A
HREF="http://www.iy2kcc.org">www.iy2kcc.org</A>) since noon yesterday.
Except for a "Condition Yellow" situation in Gambia (GNP per capita of
less than $1,000; 46% of population of 1.3 million is under the age of
14; there are fewer than 11,000 telephones), all status boxes show up
as solid green "O.K." indicators.

<P>
 A reason for grateful relief and for rejoicing?  No.   

<P>
 How we spent unaccounted for hundreds of billions of dollars to
purchase the global "Condition Green" status everywhere will be
remembered in years to come as a monumental failure in risk
management.  The hysterical ways of how Y2K programs were launched,
financed and implemented are dismal tales of how not to master
information technologies.  Here are the principal culprits:

<ol>
 <li> The Insurance Industry.  All technological innovations have been
risky and will continue to be. In due course, the insurance providers
have always found a solution of how to attribute costs to risks and
how to balance them by means of economical tradeoffs.  In this way,
nobody had to become an expert in risk assessment and face uncertainty
alone.<p>

  Insurance coverage made it possible to pool similar risks and
make the enjoyment of the benefits of a technologically advanced
society feasible. You can buy insurance policies for earthquakes,
tornadoes, oil spills, satellite launches and old age. There's a
competitive global market in risk underwriting.  There are experienced
risk assessors whose job is to come up with premiums that reflect the
probabilities of failure. They also promote standards that would help
make their guesswork result in profitable businesses.<p>

The failure of the insurance industry to assess and then underwrite
software risks is the reason why management concluded three years ago
that it had no way of evaluating their potential losses from Y2K.
Executives thus ended up in negotiations that were closer to how they
rescue hostages from hijackers instead of how they make informed
business decisions.


<P>
 <li> The Software Industry.  The persistent denial by this industry's
most-influential leaders to explain the characteristics of software
risks will remain a testimonial of their contemptuous neglect.  The
software experts were best qualified to understand and explain the
inherent fault characteristics of all software and how computer users
learned how to cope with that for more than 50 years without
catastrophic disasters.  The software experts didn't do what one could
expect from trusted professionals in carrying the message to the
public and the decision-making executives.  Instead, efforts were
concentrated either on making money from the Y2K scare, or how to
avoid blame when litigation takes place.  To compound this arrogance,
it was this leadership that has pushed through federal legislation
that would further absolve them from accountability for negligence.
If this is how the privileged leadership behaved in the case of Y2K,
how will the general public trust them as new risks emerge down the
road?

<P>
 <li> The Panderers.  This includes an assortment of academics,
authors, lecturers and consultants who offered "doomsday" prophecies
of monumental Y2K disasters without offering a shred of analytically
supported evidence to help support their claims.  In effect, they
diverted perhaps as much as 50% of the annual budget for software
innovation (over a period of several years) without any rationale that
would compare the costs with the risks.  Instead of an economically
well-reasoned approach, money had to be spent to exorcise irrational
anxieties, thus magnifying the already bad reputation of IT as a
fiscally irresponsible and unaccountable corporate activity.  To
compound this malfeasance, these promoters continued to attribute Y2K
problems to spontaneous "bugs" and the allegedly excessive costs of
magnetic storage as a way of setting the stage for absolving everyone
from any possible blame.

</ol>

<P>
 Of course I'm pleased that we didn't have a nuclear plant meltdown,
launch World War III or doom most of civilization to shiver through
wintry evenings in rooms lit and heated only with kerosene lamps.
Some of us recognize that the veneer of civilization is very thin and
can break easily.  But the conduct of our leadership in managing the
first major crisis of the information age doesn't fill me with the
pride of a major accomplishment in harnessing the enormous powers of
computing for the benefit of the people who must depend on it.  The
experience of how we got to a fault-free Jan. 1 doesn't offer a viable
precedent of how to prepare for the more difficult computer-age
challenges that are to come.


<P>

Strassmann (paul@strassmann.com) believes that the discipline of
software engineering must ultimately prevail because society will
reject getting subjected to another Y2K-like ransom bill.
