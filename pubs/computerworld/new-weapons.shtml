<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he October issue of
<i>Communications of the ACM</i> featured papers about future robots
capable of performing self-organizing tasks.</font> The authors showed how
acceleration in the processing power of computers means that machines
could soon reach the capabilities of living creatures, at an
affordable cost.

<P>The table below, from the Association for Computing Machinery
article, shows the "computing" capacity of organisms and illustrates
when commercial computers had or are expected to have equivalent
processing power.

<P>Instead of thinking about the rising potential for robotic
machines, it occurred to me that software with the intelligence of a
mouse or a monkey would have the frightening capacity to launch a new
form of network-based warfare.

<P>So far, our approach to securing information networks has been
static. The attackers write clever code that's then dispatched to
potentially vulnerable apparatus on the Internet. The hostile code is
designed to exploit the known weaknesses of millions of computers as
well as those of other programmable devices connected to the global
Web. The extent of the damage depends on the speed with which the
corruption propagates and on the speed with which defenders can deploy
countermeasures.

<P>The Security Intelligence Products and Systems organization
estimates the worldwide cost of damage from digital attacks from
Jan. 1 to mid-November of this year to be between $170 billion and
$203 billion &mdash; up from $110 billion to $130 billion for all of
2002. And that estimate doesn't include costs for installing
increasingly burdensome defensive measures.

<P>To place this figure into perspective, one must consider that the
estimated total cost of information security failures is about 10% of
the total global cost of business computing. In a year when the
increases in budgets for business computing remain in the 1%-to-2%
range, the net effect of the losses from attacks is a cut in available
spending to support money-making business applications. From that
point of view, the costs of software attacks can be seen as inflicting
economic damage comparable to that of a major terrorist incident.


<p>The question then arises of whether the current approaches to
instituting defensive measures &mdash; as promised by software vendors,
consultants and your own security personnel &mdash; will be sufficient to
overcome steadily escalating security threats. This is a classic
problem in waging defensive warfare, where the forces of attackers
must be neutralized by the capabilities of the defenders. In force
vs. counterforce war games, attackers can be defeated if the learning
cycle of the defenders is faster and their resources are adequate to
disable the aggressors.

<P>Unfortunately, the outlook for information security from the
standpoint of information warfare isn't encouraging. Current methods
of blocking intruders aren't likely to be adequate to secure Internet
commerce. When swarms of adaptively learning software attackers are
launched, they will have the capacity to sense and learn the
capabilities of the defenders and to modify their attack plans
accordingly. The balance of power will shift in favor of the
attackers. The cost of launching attacks will decrease and the expense
for defenses will escalate until it becomes prohibitive for companies
to pursue the current policy of adhering to static defensive measures.

<P>The present methods for security assurance are as obsolete as Cold
War military tactics. Regardless of how many firewalls you put up, a
software "robot" with monkey-like intelligence will find ways to punch
through and then inform other roaming attackers where to
penetrate. Regardless of how frequently you patch your software or how
often you download virus updates, self-aware mutant code will bypass
defenses that were programmed for old patterns of attack.

<P>In the new era of information warfare, network defenders must use
new tactics. They will have to launch active countermeasures to
disable the learning capabilities of the aggressors. Networks will
have to be designed for initiating search-and-destroy software that
will find attackers faster than the malevolent software can locate new
vulnerabilities. International cooperation will be essential in
identifying and neutralizing the sources of disruption. Punitive
liability will have to be applied in cases where negligence fosters
the proliferation of insecurity. Most important, the influence of CIOs
will have to rise, because security has now become the primary
impediment to further progress of a global information society.
