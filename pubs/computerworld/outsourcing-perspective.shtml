<p><font size="+2">O</font><font size="+1">utsourcing has ancient origins.</font>
It has been the basis for all trade
since the birth of organized society over 10,000 years
ago. Civilization can progress only by making the best use of
resources, wherever they may be available. That makes it necessary to
purchase goods and services you'd otherwise have to produce
yourself.<p>

Why has outsourcing suddenly become one of the most controversial
topics among IT professionals? As far as IT staffs are concerned,
outsourcing breaks up the traditional budget patterns wherein a
company had direct control over 80% of IT spending. IT outsourcing is
seen as a threat to the status quo and to the custodianship of
custom-made systems. IT staffs now have to compete with
outsiders. Systems designs that locked in costly corporate-specific
solutions now have to become open to standard and even commodity
solutions. If your job is at stake, you won't favor something that
alters a hitherto protected situation.<p>

Nevertheless, IT outsourcing is here to stay and will continue to grow
with the rise in global commerce. Therefore, it may be useful to gain
a better perspective of what outsourcing could do for your
organization. In doing so, you'll be better able to rationally cope
with outsourcing proposals whenever an economic justification for such
a move is presented at your company. To illustrate, I use the
economics of a $40 (retail price) Logitech computer mouse.<p>

Logitech Inc. is a Fremont, Calif.-based multinational company. The
mouse is assembled in China. According to <i>The Wall Street
Journal</i>, the assembly costs $3, about $1 of which is spent on
information overhead. Globally produced parts costing $14 account for
most of the mouse's manufactured costs. I estimate that the logistics
support to get the components to the assembly plant consumes about
$3.50. This leaves the company with $8 for sales, marketing, and
research and development, plus profit, with an estimated $6 of that
going toward information management. The mouse is then sent through a
distribution and retailing chain costing $15, an estimated $10 of
which is for information costs. From Logitech's standpoint, it has
outsourced 80%, all but corporate costs and profit, of the value chain
(see "Economics of IT Outsourcing" below).<p>

If the CIO of Logitech had oversight of every penny of corporate IT
spending, this would account for only 66 cents. In a typical
outsourcing contract that produces 10% in operating savings, the deal
could shave as much as 6.6 cents from total costs. From a purely
technical standpoint, such a move could be worthwhile. However, this
still begs the question of what the role of a CIO ought to be in a
multinational organization. Does the scope of the job just cover the
66 cents for corporate IT; does it include $6 for corporate
information management and $10.50 for the logistics pipeline
stretching from China to Logitech's warehouses; or is the CIO
responsible for the $20.50 in total information costs that matter when
competing against aggressive suppliers?<p>

Depending on whether outsourcing is considered from the standpoint of
the factory, management or the competitor, the outsourcing ratios
(calculated as purchased goods and services/cost inputs) would be
467%, 213% or 95%, respectively (see box below). The competitor could
then have an advantage in outsourcing less, because that company could
make product improvements more rapidly. My take is that before you
chase 6.6 cents' worth of IT cost reductions, you'd better make sure
that this won't jeopardize the capacity to improve on the $20.50 that
a competitor is striving to take over.<p>

The most frequently encountered IT management disease is
micromyopia &#151; the vision defect that appears when the manager is
pressured for immediate cost cuts. Beware of outsourcing decisions
when you can't see the value chain from the competitor's point of
view.<p>
