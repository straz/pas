<font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1"> first learned of the federal
government's "hedonic" evaluations</font> of IT budgets during budget
reviews in 1992, when a Pentagon financial examiner noted that the
Defense Department's requests for 5% annual increases in IT spending
would actually be 22.8% in the first year and much more in following
years.  Such large jumps, the analyst suggested, would be
unacceptable. <P>


I checked the math. It was numerically correct. The large gains were
generated on the basis of tables from the U.S. Department of
Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, so that the 5% for 1993 became
22.8% after adding a 17.8% implied annual cost reduction. The White
House evaluated IT spending using "inflation-adjusted" comparisons. So
a proposal for 5% salary increases would be OK because it matched the
government's official "inflationary index." But proposals for
computers were different, using a "hedonic deflationary index." This
would boost the worth of computer hardware above its cash costs using
the numbers indicated on the chart below. <P>

Hedonic, derived from the Greek language, means "of or pertaining to
pleasure." My budget examiners told me that "hedonic" was an
economist's way of saying that customers would be deriving more
pleasure from equipment that's better and cheaper to purchase.
Checking the supporting data, I found that government economists used
a mix of declining wholesale prices for desktops and laptops, plus
unit costs of disk memories and printer performance statistics, to
come up with indicators that reflected the decreasing cost and
increased performance of hardware. So a 700-MHz desktop costing $3,000
would actually be twice as good as a 350-MHz desktop purchased for the
same amount. <P>

To understand how a hedonic deflator works, consider its consequences.
Take a budget request of $1 billion in 1997 and $1 billion in 1998.
With the aid of hedonic deflators, Department of Commerce economists
would say that the $1 billion is actually worth $1.41 billion ($1
billion divided by 0.71) in 1997 and $2.13 billion ($1 billion divided
by 0.469) in 1998, compared with the $1 billion spent in 1996. <P>

There's no way an IT executive can respond to such logic, because it's
flawed. Theoretical calculations of improved computer performance
don't translate into IT budgets. Moore's Law works in electronics, but
not in budgeting. Rising IT spending can't be judged simply by
tracking catalog prices and hardware performance claims. <P>

IT spending assessments that rely on deflationary cost indexing are
used chiefly in the public sector, but this simplistic idea will
certainly appeal to someone with an MBA, especially if he's told to
find a rationale for cutting IT expenses. As IT budgets exceed 20% of
the salaries of information workers, and total IT support costs exceed
the median of U.S. manufacturers' profits, there will be more
temptation to use government-approved hedonic deflators as a whip on
the IT organization when the next recession hits. IT leaders must
understand the fallacy of such measures before dealing with inquiries
on why well-advertised cost reductions don't show up as decreased
costs or bigger benefits. <P>

Deflationary indexing isn't only a means for analyzing corporate
budgets; it's also a clever way to manipulate whatever candidates
claim in an election year. Recent boasts by the Clinton administration
that IT has contributed one-third of U.S. economic growth are
misleading. The numbers in the widely quoted Department of Commerce
publication Digital Economy 2000 are biased because the IT sector's
output was enlarged by hedonic indexing while the contributions of
long established industries were shrunk because they were adjusted
downward. <P>

IT leaders should be careful in citing enormous nationwide
productivity gains in case someone applies similar misleading metrics
to their own firms.  <P>
