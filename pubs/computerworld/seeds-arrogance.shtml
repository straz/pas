<p><font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">nformation technologies
originating in the U.S. are emerging</font> as the engines of global economic
growth in the 21st century. This deserves increased attention because
IT is becoming one of the primary sources of U.S. economic power. Yet
it's quite possible that much of the rapidly surfacing resentment
toward U.S. political dominance in global affairs may, in fact, be a
reaction to U.S. primacy in everything related to IT. National
anxieties seem to be incited by deep-seated apprehensions that most
countries aren't in a good position to compete with computer-intensive
U.S. corporations.  <P>

<P>Much of history can be read as tales describing the acquisition,
holding or loss of economic power. For instance, power conflicts among
primitive tribes reflected the battles for control over hunting
grounds. Today, it's the possession of and control over information
technologies that offer good clues about prevailing shifts in economic
power. But any dominance can breed arrogance, and that can erode the
IT industry's position in the U.S. Understanding the economic effects
of IT is essential as it becomes a global political issue.<P>


The most reliable sources of information about the current status of
IT are the published reports of public IT corporations. For 1998 and
1999, I examined the financial results of 2,272 global firms that have
been classified as making up the IT sector of the economy. This
includes companies that make computers, office equipment, software and
electronic components and their accessories, as well as companies that
provide IT-related services. Then I examined the firms' profits after
taxes. This reveals an organization's capacity to accumulate wealth
that can be reinvested. I also included total revenues to show the
relative importance of IT in the global and U.S. economies (see
chart).<P>

The U.S. companies, with 55.4% of the global revenue, take in 95.9% of
all profits. Much of this can be explained by the structure of the IT
industry. The U.S. favors a diversified collection of firms consisting
of many small and largely profitable corporations. In other countries,
the industry is concentrated in large enterprises. These huge firms
are relatively poor performers even though they rack up huge sales
figures. A further breakdown of the numbers yields some revealing
statistics.  <P>

The numbers show that that economic power - in the form of profits -
has largely shifted from hardware toward software. But it's also worth
noting that Microsoft and Oracle together account for $9.1 billion in
software profits, or 68% of the entire U.S. software industry. Without
these two firms, the U.S. position in software would look much weaker.<P>

It's also interesting that, with about half the global computer
hardware market ($303.9 billion), U.S. computer makers report profits
($15.3 billion) that are greater than the total profits for the entire
worldwide hardware industry ($11.8 billion). So, lumped together, the
non-U.S. computer makers actually lost money.  <P>

<h3>Implications</h3>

The favorable U.S. results shouldn't be a source of complacency and
certainly not a reason to believe the good times will last forever. A
study of industrial history shows that staying No. 1 in any market is
impossible. The initial cause of decline always comes from
self-inflicted wounds, attracting competitors who will assist in the
demise of an already wounded leader.  <P>

For example, the software industry - our current economic vanguard -
has arrogantly leveraged its economic muscle to seek and obtain legal
exemptions from accountability for faulty products by promoting the
passage of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act [
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/cwi/story/0,1199,NAV47_STO44398,00.html">News
Opinion</a>, Computerworld, April 10].

If there's a single cause for anxiety about the continued prosperity
of the U.S. IT industry, look no further than the self-serving actions
of overconfident companies that will cause global customers to seek
other sources of supply.  <P>
