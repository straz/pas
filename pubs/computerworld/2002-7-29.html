<font size="+2">A</font><font size="+1">n automated ROI analysis tool
set to debut in September could make it much easier</font> for IT
leaders to cost-justify technology investments to top brass.<P>

ValueIT, a Windows-based tool kit from <a target="new"
href="http://www.alinean.com/">Alinean LLC</a>, a consultancy in
Orlando, is effectively three IT budgeting tools in one. The system,
which will be priced at roughly $20,000 per seat, is designed to
calculate the return on investment of proposed projects, determine
which projects offer the greatest financial value, and benchmark IT
spending criteria against industry competitors -- such as IT spending
per employee and IT spending as a percent of revenue -- using a
database of 4,000 U.S. companies across 400-plus industry segments.<P>

A second release of the software in January is expected to offer IT
spending benchmark comparisons for 27,000 companies around the
world.<P>

One of the software tools, Project ROI, uses templates and building
blocks to create a risk-adjusted, discounted cash flow analysis of
proposed projects. <b>The software draws upon the "information
productivity" model that was conceived by Paul A. Strassmann</b>, former
CIO at the U.S. Department of Defense. Strassmann is a former
<I>Computerworld</I> columnist who now sits on Alinean's board of
directors.<P>

The software is designed to assess how IT spending relates to the
overall financial performance of a company, using financial
calculations such as economic value added, net present value and
internal rate of return.<P>

The software also draws upon a list of roughly 150 "intangible
benefits" that IT managers can plug into their ROI calculations, such
as labor costs per unit sold, customer retention rates and inventory
turns, said Tom Pisello, president and CEO of Alinean. According to
Pisello, the software can be used to measure how an IT project
contributes to the strategic goals of a company, such as increased
revenue, improved worker productivity and higher customer
satisfaction.<P>

According to CIOs and analysts who have been briefed on ValueIT, the
product should make it faster and easier for IT managers to
cost-justify projects to their bosses. <P>

"The vast majority of CIOs I know are not familiar with the current
calculation techniques that a CFO is going to be looking for in
project justification," said Garrett Grainger, CIO at <a target="new"
href="http://www.dixoncanada.com/">Dixon Ticonderoga Co.</a>, a
Heathrow, Fla.-based maker of writing instruments and art
supplies. "This tool should give [CIOs] cookie-cutter opportunities to
do that."<P>

Among the features that impressed Grainger are the intangible benefits
that can be calculated into an ROI analysis. Dixon Ticonderoga is
preparing to install a manufacturing resource planning (MRP) module
from its J.D. Edwards & Co. ERP package at its plant in Mexico City,
where officials hope to be able to measure how the MRP software
impacts employee productivity and drives other efficiency gains, said
Grainger.<P>

Although the $20,000 price tag for the software is "a big number,"
Grainger said he believes the investment is worth it, since such a
product "will save a lot of time and bad project starts and allow you
to concentrate on those projects that are going to bring value to the
company."<P>

"This product is going to see some pretty decent acceptance in the
market, tight [IT] budgets notwithstanding," said Carey Azzara, chief
research officer at Hurwitz Group Inc., a Framingham, Mass.-based
research and consulting firm. Other ROI analysis tools on the market,
such as those developed by IT consultants and the Big Five firms, are
"usually patchwork and customized to whatever the problem is the
client brings to the consultant," Azzara said.<P>

While Azzara said he thinks the $20,000 price tag for ValueIT should
be acceptable to IT managers who work in highly "siloed"
organizations, he believes that Alinean will have to "come in with
more flexible pricing" for large, distributed organizations that have
multiple IT and business managers who would be using the system. <P>

"Do the multiplication and it starts getting pretty expensive," Azzara
said.<P>

Some IT executives are more skeptical about the tool set. "I'm not
sure in this day and age, with the [IT spending] review policies that
are in place, that senior executives would rely on a piece of software
to generate their results," said Priscilla Tate, executive director of
the <a target="new"
href="http://www.techforum.com/frame.html">Technology Managers
Forum</a>, a New York-based professional association for IT managers
at midsize to large corporations.<P>

"It will be interesting to see the reactions of customers, since everyone has their own ROI metrics," added Cathy Hotka, vice president of IT at the <a target="new" href="http://www.nrf.com/Default.asp?bhcp=1">National Retail Federation</a> in Washington.<P>

A future version of the software that should be available by next
summer will include tools aimed at helping IT managers revisit an IT
project six or 12 months after it has gone into production, for
instance, to determine whether and to what extent the effort met its
business and financial objectives, said Pisello. <P>

"That's going to be great," said Grainger, since going back to check
on the returns of an IT project "is one of the hardest things for a
CIO to do" due to time and workload constraints.  <br>
