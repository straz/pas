There they go again. Once more, the IT optimists say computers are the
key to prosperity because they increase productivity. And once again,
it's just wishful thinking - only the people making the wishes are
gaining influence.<p>

Wall Street bankers, CEOs and even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan are linking much of the '90s bull market to IT-induced
productivity gains.<p>

The reasoning goes like this: The boom is caused by investors'
expectations that the economy will continue to deliver superior
profits [because of] steadily rising productivity. That largely comes
from the use of IT. The optimists make their case with an assortment
of isolated observations about work acceleration and labor cost
reductions based on anecdotes that appear in the media.<p>

The stakes in these debates are enormous. On one hand, the stock
market's performance, the prospects of achieving a balanced federal
budget and the ability to finance Social Security and Medicare all
depend on the expectation that productivity will rise steadily. On the
IS front, the presumption that computers improve productivity
legitimizes proposals to invest in computers and increase advertising
in computer magazines. <p>

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' own numbers
can't pop these bubbles of optimism, even though they indicate that
the rate of productivity increases has slowed, not risen, in recent
years. But those statistics can't be relied upon because they don't
properly account for output in the public and service sectors.<p>

The only way to settle the argument is to look at corporate
performance data.<p>

<h3>Evaluating Productivity Gains</h3>

U.S. industrial corporations include in their financial statements an
item called Sales, General & Administrative Cost (SG&A). It represents
the costs of coordinating, controlling, guiding, promoting,
motivating, training and managing employees, customers and suppliers
while making and delivering the goods.<p>

It's a reasonable approximation of the costs of managing information,
including the costs of computer hardware, software, networks and
staff. The SG&A largely accounts for a firm's overhead. It also
reflects the costs devoted to the generation and consumption of all
data.<p>

If IT would have increased the productivity of those involved in
handling information, then it would now take less SG&A to manage every
dollar's worth of Cost of Goods Sold (COG). That accounts for the
expenses for materials and labor to make those goods.<p>

A more information-productive firm would be able to process more goods
with less money spent on information-related activities.<p>


Take a case where a firm spends $100 million in COG to make boxes. It
also needs $40 million in sales and administrative expense to manage
production, distribution and selling. An advanced information system
is then introduced.<p>

The company still spends $100 million to make the same boxes, but it
now requires only $30 million in sales and administrative expense to
operate, including the cost of the new computer system. Clearly, the
productivity of information management shows an improvement.<p>

<h3>Gains for U.S. Industrial Firms</h3>

Whether U.S. industrial firms, after a decade of intensive
computerization and spending about $500 billion on new computer
applications, can now operate with less information management is
something that can be tested. How much COG is supported for every
dollar spent on SG&A?<p>

To give the optimists their best shot, I examined the financial
records over the past 10 years of the 66 largest and most prestigious
U.S. industrial corporations, each with annual revenue of more than
$10 billion (see chart).<p>

resources at the 66 largest US industrial corporations."><p>

Contrary to expectations, productivity hasn't improved during the past
decade. The amount of SG&A required to manage every dollar's worth of
COG hasn't fallen, despite massive IT investments. There was a steady
increase in SG&A from 1987 through 1993.<p>

Though I show gains in the productivity ratio since 1993, the cost of
information management relative to COG was still higher last year than
it was in 1987 and 1988.<p>

I completed a similar analysis for 16 of the largest U.S. banks. The
declining trend in the ratio of revenue to payroll costs confirms a
drop in productivity.<p>

<h3>Significance for CIOs</h3>

Information costs have risen, not declined, in relation to other
production costs. Neither client/server, the Internet nor computer
networks have so far materially improved the productivity of
information handling by the premier U.S. industrial corporations. In
1996, $1.1 trillion in cost of goods required $300.5 billion in SG&A
expense. That ratio is now lower than it was in the period from 1987
through 1990. I found a similar gap in the productivity for the U.S.
banks I surveyed.<p>

I consider this proof that productivity of the information-handling
workforce, which now accounts for 59% of U.S. employment, has
worsened, not improved.<p>

The time has come to face the facts: The stock-market analysts and the
overoptimistic CEOs are being misled.<p>

It's a myth that computers have measurably increased the overall
productivity of information management.  Whatever gains may have
happened took place in factories and warehouses.<p>

Such a realization will lead to placing IT expenses -
which now support mostly office workers - under much closer
scrutiny to make sure that costs are not only contained, but that
the computerized work creates an innovative stream of new profits.<p>

Whatever productivity gains may have been achieved through
computerization of office work in the past decade have been squandered
by the profligate waste of human and technological resources. The
bureaucratization and complexity of business processes have also
increased how much information processing is necessary to get anything
accomplished, without benefits for the consumer.<p>

If prosperity is to continue, we need to fulfill the promise of the
Information Age. We must deploy IT so the office workforce can
consistently deliver more valuable results with less effort.<p>
