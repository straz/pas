Matching the names of CIOs who appeared on a verified lists at the start of
1994 and again at the start of 1995 confirms that their average job-holding
expectancy was about  30 months, and probably less than that. If such a high
instability persists, it is likely to accelerate the outsourcing of information
systems support services. It will reinforce the prevailing tendencies towards
increasingly chaotic solutions to systems management problems.<p>

In the story about the three little pigs the rationale for building a house out
of twigs is a short-term thinking perspective. If the prospects of a CIO's
career continue to be brief, firms can expect to operate with flimsy systems.<p>

To build a long-lasting, low-maintenance systems architecture for a corporation
would take at least seven years. Where the burden of maintaining legacy
applications consumes most of the available resources, the planning cycle for
getting things right may extend well beyond ten years. This is why the subject
of CIO job-holding experiences should be of interest.

<h3>Earlier Studies</h3>

Stories about the short life of CIOs have been widely quoted in magazine
articles for the last four years. When tracing the origins of these stories I
always ended up with three surveys - two from major consulting firms, one by a
recruiting consultant. In each instance the average job-holding time for a CIO
was alleged to be either 25 or 28 months. <p>

A recent survey report in <i>Computerworld</i> suggested that the
CIO's time-on-the-job may be somewhat longer, about 34 months. How
these surveys were obtained remains a mystery. My first reaction to
these numbers was one of incredulity. One does not survey nurses in
the emergency ward of an inner-city hospital for statistically valid
opinions about the health of urban population. <p>

The 1994 <i>CW Premier 100</i> survey did examine the question of CIO
longevity. It concluded that the mean time of CIOs in position was 6.1 years,
with a median of four years. There was one CIO who has been on the job for over
25 years - clearly a candidate for a medal!<p>

The <i>Premier 100</i> were the best of the Fortune 1000 in terms of
information productivity. Therefore, they were not a representative sample of
what could be expected. Nevertheless,  I could not believe that the differences
in job longevity between the U.S. average and the Premier 100 firms could be
very large.

<h3>Taking Names</h3>

There was only one way of finding out for sure what was the CIO turnover rate.
It just happens that I have an independently validated 1994 and 1995 mailing
list of CIOs. All I had to do is to merge the two lists and see which names
remained the same from year to year.<p>

From a list of 496 firms only 232 names of CIOs showed up both in 1994 as well
as in 1995. Seventy four firms (see list below) changed CIOs in one year. That
yields a turnover rate of 24.2%, or an average tenure expectancy of 30 months.
<p>

The fate of the CIOs in the 109 firms for which I could not account for the
CIOs longevity is a matter of anyone's guess. I gave good reasons to believe
that about half of these firms have swapped out their CIOs. If that guess is
approximately correct, the consultants' and the recruiter's findings alleging
25-28 months terms in will be right.

<h3>Implications</h3>

One view of the roles of a CIO defines it as the development, custody,
preservation, safeguarding and enhancement of the information assets of a firm.
That implies that CIO should take a long-term view of what needs to be done.
Holding a job only for a short time is inconsistent with carrying out long term
commitments.<p>

In fact, the relaxation with which many CIOs have viewed the coming of
year 2000 suggests that they have always counted on not being around
when time comes to account for a perfectly predictable disaster. Thus,
short time on a job becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is a
telling symptom of the disease that makes our information technologies
less effective than their potential.<p>
