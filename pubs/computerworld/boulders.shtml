Trustworthy leaders don't talk only about destinations. They also
explain how to overcome obstacles along the way. Microsoft still has a
lot of explaining to do.

<P> Bill Gates staked out his vision of the decades ahead in his 1995
manifesto, The Road Ahead. Since then, we've been exposed to Gates'
vision through his speeches and Microsoft's advertising campaigns,
such as the recent series about delivering a Digital Nervous System
that will make information systems &quot;work together.&quot; We've
also heard the promise of Zero Administration costs for PC software.
None of those marketing initiatives, based on my close following of
news from Redmond, alters the view of the future as it was articulated
in Gates' book.

<P> So more than two years after The Road Ahead was published, how
does Microsoft propose to remove the boulders blocking the information
superhighway and impeding global computing in the Information Age? <p>

<h3>A Boulder On The Road: Interoperability</h3> 

<P> The Holy Grail of computerdom is the achievement of
interoperability. It means not having to worry how data, applications
and hardware will work as technology changes. Everyone - including
readers of The Road Ahead - has run into problems with incompatible
text, data, images and peripherals. The CD-ROM that came with Gates'
book ran on Windows 95, but not Windows NT.

<P> Today, we're still wondering how Microsoft will deliver on the
book's promise that &quot;. . . Microsoft operating systems provide
compatibility and interoperability . . . developers do not need to
worry about what PC their software will run.&quot; Today, Microsoft
isn't fully inter-operable even within its own product line and
certainly doesn't practice easy handshakes with software and hardware
vendors who don't strictly and narrowly comply with Microsoft's
formats.

<P> How those barriers will be removed is something that concerns
every systems manager. We're still waiting for a cogent plan - other
than homogenizing everyone into a mold set by one supplier and setting
proprietary standards of interoperability for everyone else.

<h3>Another Boulder On The Road: Power</h3> 

Meanwhile, Microsoft's ambitions and aggressive methods have caused
widespread apprehensions. The paranoia of software companies,
antitrust lawyers and state regulators has spread throughout corporate
America. A story in the April 27 issue of Fortune carries the
headline: &quot;Microsoft: Is your company its next meal? Now even the
giants of the Fortune 500 have reasons to fear.&quot;

<P> Simple arithmetic propels those anxieties. To maintain current
growth and financial performance, Microsoft's profits must rise to
about one-third of all profits earned by the 3,000 largest U.S.
corporations. If that happens, Microsoft's revenue would equal
three-quarters of the combined global revenues of GM, Ford, Chrysler,
Honda and Toyota. But size and the cash in Microsoft's war chest
aren't the only sources of fears. CEOs finally have realized that
Microsoft's operating system straddles every access gate to their
information networks. It's as if a single locksmith provided both the
keys and the locks for every door in the world.

<P> The Road Ahead avoids the issue altogether. I did a full-text
search in the book for words such as &quot;monopoly,&quot;
&quot;obstacles&quot; and &quot;dominance&quot; and found one
reference to the game of Monopoly, one to the late An Wang and
electronic calculators and two references to telephone company
monopolies. Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to deny that it's
exhibiting any monopolistic tendencies, as evidenced in recent Senate
hearings.

<P> The only obstructions to creating the information society
mentioned in the book are the bandwidth barriers put in place by
telephone and cable companies. Those themes continue to be repeated in
most of Gates' recent talks and are supported with an aggressive
investment and acquisition agenda in cable companies and satellite
ventures.

<P> To me, talking about bandwidth barriers instead of addressing the
acute issues around Microsoft's dominance in operating systems and
desktop applications looks like a signal that Microsoft wants to
extend its reach. Redmond doesn't just want to supply the keys and
locks for the world's computers. It also wants to manage the
electronic pathways leading to them. No wonder such aspirations tend
to increase suspicions about an organization with that much power.

<P> Microsoft's visions about the road ahead must now respond to
rising concerns over whether its claims to leadership will expose its
followers to unanticipated risks.

<h3>Advice To Travelers On The Road Ahead</h3>

Microsoft is an admirable organization. It has delivered universal
solutions that have made it possible to extend computing power beyond
the limits and imagination of companies that initially possessed
greater resources and superior technologies. Its success has been
well-earned because it has consistently delivered good value, compared
with what competitors offered.

<P> But nothing dominates forever, as I found out after years of
committing my companies to follow the computing path as preached and
delivered by IBM. IBM failed to recognize that its chosen &quot;road
ahead&quot; didn't lead where its customers wanted to go. We should
remain skeptical about Bill Gates' vision until he and his associates
tell us how they propose to cope with the obstacles to their
idealistic-sounding visions.<p>

applications with an eye toward interoperability.
