<font size="+2">T</font>he vendors of off-the-shelf software are getting away with product  
 warranties whose language renders them worthless. They are forcing us to 
 accept fault-free cover-ups of persistently defective software. <p>

 You would never buy an automobile or a refrigerator that offers as little 
 protection and as great dependency as the software on which our information 
 society is built. If we made trucks, pharmaceuticals and radios the way we 
 engineer software, our economy would still be stuck in the early era of 
 industrial development.<p> 
 
<h3>Customer Expectations</h3>
 
 In just about every other industry, consumers have many ways to get faulty 
 products replaced. Many companies offer meaningful guarantees and 
 warranties. Consumers may successfully sue manufacturers for damages from 
 defective products, especially if the manufacturer was negligent.<p>

 Manufacturers have been forced to disclose information about the quality and 
 dangers of their products. The old buyer-beware attitude is out. Consumers 
 now demand that sellers be accountable for how their products are used.<p> 
  
<h3>Accountability Avoidance</h3> 
 Unfortunately, off-the-shelf-software companies still think they don't have 
 to be responsible for product quality. 
 Consider a typical software installation process. First, you get a window 
 with 14 lines of tiny type asking, "Do you accept all of the terms?" If you 
 choose "No," the setup will close. So everyone clicks "Yes" and prays 
 nothing will crash the system. <p> 
 
 What did you just agree to? To find out, you have to scroll through at least 
 10 hard-to-read windows because you can't enlarge or print the text. 
 Typically, you will find you have given consent to absolve the vendor from 
 any responsibility whatsoever. The vendor has agreed only that "... software 
 will substantially conform to the applicable documentation ..." (ha!) and 
 that it "... makes no warranty or representation, either express or implied, 
 with respect to the software, documentation, quality, performance, 
 usability, condition, compatibility, security, accuracy, merchantability, or 
 fitness for a particular purpose." I particularly relish the clause that 
 states "... customer waives any claims even if the vendor has been advised 
 of the possibility of damages ..." <p> 
 
 What does that mean? For instance, by clicking Yes, you will have absolved 
 the vendor of responsibility for known defects in security that would lead 
 to a compromise of your confidential data. By clicking Yes, you will have 
 agreed not to blame the vendor for a rare combination of commands that will 
 wipe clear your entire disk. <p> 
 
 Even the few, ephemeral commitments contained in these warranties are 
 worthless. Consider this pledge: "What you accepted is that the software 
 vendor will only have to cover either the purchase price paid or the costs 
 of repairs [bug fixes] to the software package, but only if such fixes are 
 available." But even that is void in case of your "misapplication," as 
 judged in the sole discretion of the courts in the vendor's hometown. <p>

 In dollar terms, such remedies are meaningless. For instance, I have just 
 completed a review of the time lost by a large financial firm from failures 
 caused by off-the-shelf software. It added up to approximately 6.5 hours per 
 month per person, or a total of $135 million per year. That's a very large 
 multiple of the purchase price for the firm's software for one year. <p> 
 
 The manufacturers of electrical devices -- motors, spark plugs and circuit 
 boards -- provide generous warranties because their products are 
 manufactured to defined specifications and quality standards. The software 
 industry doesn't offer such warranties because its products are rushed to 
 market after insufficient testing, in disregard of the pain the products may 
 inflict on the buyers. <p> 
 
 It's time the software industry joined the universal quest for greater 
 product reliability and ended to shoddy software. <p> 
 
 We users can't accept any more quack claims about capabilities and features 
 for which the vendor assumes no responsibility. We must have performance 
 warranties, test certification and assured performance levels to keep costs 
 down and productivity up. We can't let a vendor ship operating systems with 
 gaping holes that let infocriminals gain control of a business. We can't 
 suffer applications that destroy data and wipe out ongoing work. We must not 
 tolerate software so faulty that even the vendor's own experts can't install 
 a peripheral device without crashing the system in a public demonstration. <p> 
 
 My advice to buyers of off-the-shelf software is to rebel against 
 contractual language that will place their careers at risk. Soon, negligence 
 lawyers with experience gained from year 2000 lawsuits will turn their 
 sights on organizations that have put up with software that's causing damage. <p>

 Please read the fine print. The verbiage you strike out may be the words 
 that could hang you.<p>

 expects that if the software industry doesn't 
 deliver quality products, lawyers and regulators will ensure that it does, 
 in a most unpleasant manner. </font><p>
