<h2>Best practices? Or placebos?</h2>

Need advice on how to manage IS? Watch out for those
who claim to know what "best practices" will fit all
companies.</font><p>

Some of the most prominent U.S. consultants and advisory services now
present their clients with comprehensive checklists of what are, in
their opinion, the attributes of excellence for managing information
systems.<p>

Advisory services offer tips and high-priced periodic reports on
whatever topic seems to befuddle information executives. Large
consulting firms collect their best practices in an unending stack of
loose-leaf binders. Those become handy sources of repeatable advice
for their less experienced consultants.<p> 

Having a comprehensive compilation of best practices is good business.
A recent series of full page advertisements from one of the largest
consulting firms declared that " ... our professionals will start by
sharing ... what works best for others."<p>

Receiving the "best" advice is always appealing to managers
looking for assurance that they are doing the right thing. But beware:
It can spell ruin for IS managers.<p>

Any idealized list of what is "best" could be irrelevant in dealing
with a company's unique maladies. Managers who adopt generic lists
without understanding their companies' real problems, priorities,
schedules and budgets are sure to end up searching for new jobs.<p>

Consultants don't explain how they come up with their suggestions
except by mentioning that they reflect the experts' views. Nor do the
originators of best practices lists explain how they validated their
prescriptions with independent performance measures such as
profitability.<p>

Consultants like the best practices approach because it lets them
write an impressive report based on their firms' preferred practices
and methodologies.<p>

But if you are still sanguine about best practices lists, consider
this: There is evidence that excellence can't be based on complying
with even the most elaborate set of desirable attributes. Just
consider the most prestigious prize in U.S. business the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award, given out annually by the U.S.
Department of Commerce.<p>

<h3>The Baldrige award</h3>

The checklist to qualify for the Baldrige award is by far the most
comprehensive catalog of what experts believe to be prescriptions for
excellence. Specially appointed examiners rate hundreds of acts before
they can certify that an organization has earned a nomination.<p>

How have those "quality" companies fared in the real world? I examined
the financial results of all 23 Baldrige winners through last year. My
purpose was to discover if economic performance is related to the high
ratings for complying with what prominent experts believed to be
standards for excellence.<p>

Ten organizations are privately held or have been merged, and
therefore financial data isn't available. One of those firms, Wallace
Co., filed for bankruptcy protection two years after it won the
Baldrige in 1990.<p>

Of the remaining 13, results are published only for the parent
company, some of which entered just one of their major divisions in
the contest. Nevertheless, in each case the parent company spread the
fame to the entire firm. Therefore, I felt justified to look at the
total financial results of the Baldrige winners.<p>

Only two of the 13 firms show a positive economic value-added (defined
as profits minus costs of shareholder equity) for the seven-year
period from 1988 through 1994. Solectron Corp. and Corning, Inc. added
$134 million to the U.S. economy. Eleven of the winning firms,
including Armstrong World Industries, Inc., Eastman Chemical Co.,
Xerox Corp., Federal Express Corp., Texas Instruments, Inc.,
Westinghouse Electric Corp., General Motors Corp. and IBM, show
negative economic value-added. They detracted $101 billion from the
U.S. economy.<p>

<h3>Implications for CIOs</h3>

Consultants, as well as government agencies, have developed exhaustive
checklists of generic best solutions for IS. They are comparable to a
pharmacist's reference book that lists all the wonderful vitamins,
miracle drugs, ointments and injections.<p>

But consuming the best pharmaceuticals indiscriminately won't
guarantee superior health. Medicines are effective only after correct
diagnosis, correct prescription, adherence to instructions and
continued good care.<p>

Instead of seeking to adopt the best practices from somebody's list,
chief information officers would be better off by first coming up with
ways to determine what their firms really need. CIOs need to devise
processes that will assure that they comprehend and can measure what
performance goals are worthwhile. Only after that is done is it safe
to look up a catalog of good ideas and find which ones may fit their
situation.<p>

IS executives should beware of anyone who invokes generally applicable
best practices as the source of his or her authority. <b>No one has
yet demonstrated that there are universal insights for delivery of
systems superiority.</b> Not enough is yet known about the influences
that deliver exceptional organizational performance. Anyone who
presumes he or she can compile a generic list of what makes excellent
information management is guilty of peddling placebos instead of
curing ills.
