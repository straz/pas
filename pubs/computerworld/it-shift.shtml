<font size="+2">W</font><font size="+1">indows, Unix, Linux, SPARC,
Pentium and Merced</font> &#151; there's nothing technologists love more than a debate
about operating systems and microprocessors. But soon, those debates will be
irrelevant. We have reached the end of computer history as we know it. <p>

Fifty years of CPU- and operating-system-centric computing is ending. Large
organizations are on the  threshold of an era that will be characterized by
widespread diffusion of the computing function. In the next five years, the
economics of computing will cause work to be dispersed to autonomous systems that
will combine as needed for cooperation, without having to depend on specific
operating systems and microprocessors to function at all. <p>

According to International Data Corp., this year's worldwide spending on IT will be $1.6
trillion. At a conservative future annual growth rate of 9%, total IT spending
for the next decade will be $30 trillion. That's simply not affordable. The
demise of computing as we know it will be forced by the following:<p>

<ul>
<LI>In 1997, U.S. spending of $660 billion on IT neared that of corporate wages
and salaries ($732 billion) and was rising at a faster rate. That makes IT an
attractive target for cost reduction when an economic slowdown occurs.<p>

<LI>Forty-six percent (and rising) of business capital investment is  in
computing equipment. Now that corporate allocations to IT have been reached,
growing needs for investments in energy, transportation and manufacturing must be
met.<p>

<LI>The "computer paradox" remains. There's no demonstrable relationship between
computer spending and corporate profits. Executives can no longer tolerate that.<p>

<LI>There's no technical reason why each of the 500 million corporate desktop
computers estimated to be put in place in the next five years needs
mainframe-like overhead such as 20 million to 60 million lines of code, gigabyte
files and a managerial complexity that I estimate amounts to at least $3,000 to
$5,000 each in excess overhead.<p>

</ul>

Despite all the talk about distributed computing and e-commerce, the reality is
that the principal appliances of the computer age are the Wintel machines. Their
architecture is an embodiment of centralized thinking. The operating system must
be fully informed about every conceivable feature and event.<p>

The extremely successful Wintel offerings are the result of valiant efforts to
include everyone within their fold through cooperation, backward compatibility,
software engineering tools, added features and options that accommodate increased
variety. Although commendable, those efforts have led inevitably to a level of
complexity that is manageable only at exorbitant costs.<p>

The Wintel central control approach to computing is doomed to economic failure
because it passes on to its customers huge administrative costs and enormous
risks for uninsurable failures. Corporate management is searching for simple,
low-cost and reliable solutions.<p>

My bets are on these major innovations:<p>

<ul>
<LI>User devices without an operating system, memory, compilers, browsers and
peripheral drivers. With high-speed corporate intranets, most office workers need
only a panel driven from network servers that can benefit from the economies of
reduced overhead costs, increased reliability and superior security.<p>

<LI>Software applets that run on "virtual machines," which make every "client"
device independent of processor technology and unrelated to the choice of an
operating system. Because they can function without requiring support from a
specific choice of technology, such software will also have a much longer
economic life than today's software, resulting in an enormous improvement in
life-cycle costs.<p>

<LI>Software that can communicate, interact and support business services without
central control that guides their every step.<p>
</ul>

The consequences of this transformation are far-reaching. Most of the code and
all of the organizational forms based on central planning will crumble. Those who
bet on the new architectures will prosper. <P>

innovations that create value instead of costly maintenance.
