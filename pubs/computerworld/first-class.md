Paul A. Strassmann, an IT management consultant and *Computerworld*
columnist who has served as the CIO at several large companies and
federal agencies, says there are three kinds of CIOs, and if you want
to be well respected, you should strive for the top category.

The "technology CIO" is on the lowest rung of the ladder and controls
3% or less of the company's total budget -- basically direct spending
for IT people and gear, he says. Next comes the "information resources
CIO," who controls not only technology spending but also spending on
information resources generally, perhaps 30% of the budget. At the top
sits the "information strategy CIO," who ultimately has some influence
over 100% of the budget.

"When you are a technology CIO everybody hates you, because when the
e-mail goes down, it's your fault," Strassmann explains. "If you want
to be appreciated, you have to get an upgrade."

To move ahead, Strassmann offers this advice: "Pull up your socks and
get going. Stop grousing and make a contribution. My grandfather told
me that -- you either pull up your socks or you die."
