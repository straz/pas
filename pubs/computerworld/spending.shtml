<h2>Information: America's favorite investment</h2>

<font size="+1"> U.S. businesses spend more on information
technologies and information management than on other technologies or
investments. It's time to rethink information management and IT
spending.</font><p>

Money talks. And it talks more clearly about priorities than anything
else. If you look at the statistics, information has become the most
important way for companies to invest in their future.<p>

Information technologies - computers, telephony, video, etc. - have
become the preferred business tooling investment for U.S.
corporations. And more corporate cash is spent on information
management than on the annual costs of shareholder equity, according
to my calculations.<p>

The shift is so striking that one may rightfully designate the U.S. as
having entered the Computer Age after 1982, in the same way that
historians describe evolutionary progression in terms of the Stone,
Iron or Automobile ages. After all, civilizations are defined by the
tools they use. But this epoch making shift has other ramifications
for chief information officers and how information systems payoffs
should be measured.<p>
  
<h3>Well funded expenditure </h3>

Business tooling is defined by economists as producer durable
equipment and is one of the most telling indicators of business
priorities.<p>

The number of executives who say they will increase spending on
computer hardware and software has more than doubled in the past five
years. Computer purchase plans are funded better than expenditures for
all other business tooling.<p>

This shift in preferences is best illustrated by showing the relative
shares of capital spending in recent history:<p>

process equipment as well as office fixtures.<p>

Business equipment spending not reflected in this chart includes
airecraft, power plants, electrical equipment, and other heavy
equipment.<p></font>

<p>

Skeptics may argue that a better measure of the priority given to
information is how much of a company's revenue is invested in
information technology. But that is a misleading indicator.<p>

The costs of information technologies average only 2% of a firm's
revenue, but they can have an enormous influence on a firm's
operations. They have become the principal means of improving existing
business processes. Just as in the human body, the relative weight of
critical organs, such as the kidneys, isn't a good indicator of their
importance.<p>

<h3>Just a small piece</h3>

Computers make up only a small share of the total information costs of
a firm because most of these expenses are for executives, managers,
administrators, clerical and technical staffs or for technology
purchases. Computers also make up only a small share of the costs of a
firm's assets - averaging less than 0.3%.<p>

Therefore, a better way to assess the relative importance of
information is to calculate the ratio of the costs of information
management - which I define as sales, general and administrative plus re
search and development expense - to the costs of shareholder equity,
which is the net value of all assets minus liabilities.<p>

A firm's ratio of information management to shareholder equity is the
most appropriate indicator of whether a company is information
intensive or capital intensive. If a firm is overwhelmingly
information intensive, the role of the CIO rises in importance for
assuring the success of the enterprise. I have calculated this ratio
for 2,186 major U.S. corporations. The results are best illustrated
below:<p>

<b>Company spending on information management for every dollar spent on
shareholder equity</b><p>

Some 1,926 corporations spent more on information management than on
shareholder equity in 1994. <p>

Only 260 firms, or 11.9% of U.S.  companies, were found to depend
primarily on shareholder capital as the most important input resource.
About 70 years ago, capital would have dwarfed information costs.<p>

<h3>Implications</h3>

The increased reliance on computers as a business tooling investment
while corporate costs shift from capital to information has far
reaching implications:<p>

<dl> 
<li>The CIO should concentrate on enhancing the effectiveness
and productivity of information management, not the efficiency of
computers. Even large reductions in the expenditures for computers
can't impact profits as much as a small gain in the effectiveness of
information management.<p>

<li>The conventional measures of payoff on invested capital - return
on assets or return on investment - are increasingly irrelevant. These
ratios, inherited from the industrial era of scarce capital, evaluate
the productivity of something that is of diminishing importance.
Instead, CIOs should assist corporate executives in applying better
measures in evaluating the productivity of people who are engaged in
the use of information resources.
