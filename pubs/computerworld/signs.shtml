<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he recent gyrations of
Standard & Poor's stock market indicators</font> should serve as a warning
that recently liberal IT spending habits should now revert to more
realistic levels. The accompanying graph shows the divergence between
two indicators.

<P>The graph (see below) conveys two insights that IT executives must comprehend
to get a better perspective of what may happen next.

<P>First, technology buyers managed to keep only level market
valuations during what was claimed to be one of the biggest economic
booms in U.S. history. They spent wildly on IT but couldn't
demonstrate to investors that the technology-driven New Economy was
delivering spectacular gains. Now that a prosperous decade is ending,
it should be clear that IT buyers may become reluctant to keep
investing in more technology at recent growth rates.

<P>Second, technology stocks lagged behind the rest of the Standard &
Poor's index until 1995, even though their revenues were growing
faster than IT buyers' revenues. It appears that investors kept
discounting the worth of volatile future earnings of firms that
produced short-lived technologies. Now, with a possible recession
looming, customers will resist making commitments to another round of
rapidly obsolescent technologies on a scale comparable to that of 1999
and last year.

<P>There are three plausible explanations for such differences in trends:

<P>One is the casino gambler's greed. He knows that the house odds are
always against him. But he keeps playing with the expectation of
winning big, as other players lose enough money to make him rich.

<P>The second is fear. Starting in 1997, the Y2k scare loosened every
firm's purses for largely unrestrained spending.

<P>The third explanation is intimidation. Sane economic restraints
were thrown away when the frenzy to replace the $1 trillion that had
been invested in client/server installations stimulated the rush to
Internet-based systems. The Web, B2C and B2B e-commerce have been sold
as survival games, forcing firms to participate without proof of
payoffs. A parade of gurus preached that unless you rearmed with the
latest technology, you'd die when global competition was unleashed.
That scared enough CEOs and chief financial officers to allow spending
and salaries to reach unprecedented levels.

<P><b>Implications</b>

<P>The prudent IT executive should cut back on major spending that
doesn't have much chance of delivering profits. When the budget
analysts start scraping every IT expense item to boost already reduced
earnings, they shouldn't find too much fat. The scarcity of funds
doesn't mean to halt innovation. The beauty of our economy is that
there are enough aspiring entrepreneurs who are willing to sweat long
hours to invent and test new technologies. In the next few years, it
will be advantageous - and surely less risky - for each corporation to
buy, rather than create, new technologies.

<P>To survive, IT executives will have to concentrate on getting
costs, reliability and quality engineered to perfection. It's back to
basics for a while, which means squeezing every penny out of ongoing
operations. But it would be a fatal flaw to outsource operations,
especially if existing staff can fix them. The prevailing fiction
about how to run IT is to outsource bread-and-butter operations while
keeping responsibility for resume-enhancing innovations. The results
of such a policy, in every case I've examined, are higher corporate IT
expenses and never having enough qualified talent to manage
contractors and compete with increasingly hungry entrepreneurs.

<P>The stock market is saying that the end of euphoria has arrived and
that productivity results, rather than "visions," will probably
prevail in the next few years.
