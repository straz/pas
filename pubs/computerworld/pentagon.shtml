<font size="+2">I</font><font size="+1">n a talk in March, John
Chambers, the knowledgeable CEO of Cisco Systems, noted that the
U.S. Department of Defense is emerging as a pioneer in systems
architectures.</font> The DOD has become an innovator in supporting
real-time responsiveness across an enterprise.<P>

Noteworthy is the technology guidance from Deputy Secretary of Defense
Paul Wolfowitz and the just-retired DOD CIO John Stenbit. They
proposed strategies to cope with the war on terrorism as the DOD finds
itself saddled with a computing and telecommunications infrastructure
that consumes over half of the department's IT resources [<A
HREF="curse.shtml">"The Curse of IT Infrastructure"</A>]. The
DOD doesn't have sufficient capabilities to meet rising operational
requirements. Just about all of its assets are mortgaged to keep the
existing systems running. Only a radical transformation, now defined
as the Global Information Grid (GIG), can offer a viable way to
achieve real-time interoperability among defense systems.<P>

Suppliers and contractors are replacing obsolete technologies with
lower-cost products and services, but that won't yield sufficient
funds to pay for urgently needed innovations. There isn't enough time
to gradually swap old technologies for new ones, as has been the
practice for half a century. New needs can be satisfied only by speedy
changes in the ways systems are designed and operated.<P>

The DOD is stuck with the fixed costs to support well over $1 trillion
worth of accumulation from mainframe- and desktop-centric
acquisitions. To escape that bondage and confront rapidly rising
threats to our security, the DOD has come up with an architecture that
meets the new requirements at materially lower costs. It's an
architecture that makes it possible to migrate rapidly without the
resulting chaos seen in the efforts to modernize information systems
for the Navy and the Marine Corps.<P>

The objective of the GIG is to move all DOD applications from the
current broadcast, point-to-point and interapplication communications
to a virtual and secure, enterprisewide ultrawideband bus. It's based
on the operating doctrine of "posting information and knowledge for
real-time availability" by means of "universal data-element-level
interoperability." This is quite a mouthful, but it means that the GIG
will (1) support the entry of data to readily accessible files as
early as possible, and preferably at the point of origin; (2) provide
users with the improved capability to pull whatever data they need,
whenever they need it; and (3) ensure that information security
measures are applied at every point of entry and exit from the GIG.<P>

The central capability of the GIG will be to deliver Six Sigma-quality
secure messaging, collaboration, services management, content
assurance, knowledge discovery and enterprisewide archiving
services. The GIG will provide visibility, access and delivery of
information services to all of the DOD as well as to others engaged in
national security. It will enable authorized and individually
authenticated persons to search the networks for information
services.<P>

The GIG represents a fundamental shift to a service-oriented view of what an information infrastructure must make feasible. It requires a dedicated and fully assured network environment, populated with information that's readily available, secure, reliable and scalable on demand - not just as specified in budget estimates. To the extent possible, the GIG will use existing applications via standard middleware gateways for eventual migration of all information assets into the GIG architecture.<P>

The Pentagon accumulated incompatible hardware and noninteroperable
software because it relied on obsolete assumptions about technology
acquisitions. To save money as it moves to its GIG architecture, the
DOD must take a new approach that involves the following steps:<P>

<UL><LI>Substitute communications bandwidth for computing hardware.</LI><P>

<LI>Rely on standardized data in lieu of costly integration of unique
data. All data will have associated metadata to help users discover
the utility of shared data.</LI><P>

<LI>Replace wired networks with wireless connectivity.</LI><P>

<LI>Eliminate application-specific architectures for enterprisewide
grid systems.</LI><P>

<LI>Eliminate on-site support for fixing hardware and software by
using preventive remote diagnostics.</LI><P>

<LI>Apply middleware interfaces to deal with nonstandard data
definitions.</LI><P>

<LI>Implement perimeter security instead of relying on local
security.</LI></UL><P>

The GIG architecture is a breakthrough in thinking about all
information infrastructures. It's worthy of consideration by every
CIO, whether in business or in government. The development of the GIG
warrants watching because it's based on an approach that applies to
all who depend on information superiority to compete.<p>
