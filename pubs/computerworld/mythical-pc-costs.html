<h2>The Mythical PC Cost</h2>

<h3>What are the real costs of personal computing?</h3>

The average costs of ownership of a personal computer have finally
made the headlines. In the last two weeks Fortune Magazine quoted the
annual costs of PC ownership as more than $9,000, London Economist at
$6,400, the New York Times at $13,000, Business Week at $8,000 and
Datamation at $10,543. The most frequent source of these numbers is
the Gartner Group, who will oblige with estimates ranging from $7,138
to the frequently mentioned $13,000 figure depending on who, when and
how asks the question.<p>

I find all of these quotes remarkable. For the last fifteen years the
PC was the low cost answer to mainframes. Yet, my annual costs for
supporting computer terminals from central computing were always below
$3,000 per year.<p>


<h3>Talking about large sums</h3>

All of this sudden interest in the real costs of personal computing
originates from the prospects of a $500 Network Computer displacing a
$2,500 Personal Computer.<p>

If you happen to be the CEO, CFO or CIO of a large organization, such
proliferation of figures could cause confusion. A typical Fortune 1000
corporation, with an annual IT budget of $200 million is likely to
have about 10,000 personal computers. If your CFO takes the highest
Gartner numbers and the low-ball claims of $2,500 for the cost of
ownership of an NC, that could lead to a hypothetical cost reduction
of $105 million.<p>

 If you prefer the Economist, you could argue that there is only $34
millions worth of savings available through networking dependency.
However, to deliver Intranet-run NC's you will need $60 million worth
of new development money. You will need that to bail you out of the
latest client/server cycle that increased chaos under the slogan of
local empowerment.<p>


No wonder, translating claims into bottom line cash becomes an
arguable proposition. Mythical savings based on mythical costs are a
sure-fire invitation for another CIO to come under the
guillotine.<p>

<h3>Learning about PC costs</h3>

My interests in the real costs of personal computing go back to 1991.
I was searching for ways of finding $35 billions of cost reductions
over a seven year budget cycle in the Pentagon. With an estimated
population of PC's about 1.5 million an understanding of the potential
costs of ownership could make a contribution to the &quot;peace dividend.&quot;
I commissioned a study of thirty-two PC local area networks.  I wanted
to pin down the headcount tending to these nets.<p>

One net enjoyed the services of one support technician for six UNIX
workstations masquerading as mainframes. After adding all of the
related costs that amounted to well over $14,000 per station per year.
There was one net performing highly sophisticated functions where the
costs were over $60,000 per seat. It was secret and therefore not
quotable.<p>

Another net managed to get by with only one part-time contractor. It
consisted of every sixty-eight Macintoshes running three child-proof
applications. That would cost barely $3,500 per seat. Clearly, there
was no such thing as an average cost for personal computing. The
Department of Defense would never demonstrate to the Congress that it
could save 1.5 million times $10,500 per year, or a neat $15.8 billion
dollars.<p>

<h3>The facts</h3>

It just happens that I work closely with a network management firm
that offers full PC support services for a fixed annual fee. It has
every incentive to increase customer satisfaction while spending as
little money as possible. Their price is below $3,000 per seat per
year. How do they achieve that? They have a model that explains what
creates costs of PC ownership:<p>

The model suggests that there are two major influences in determining
the costs of PC ownership: workload and management practices. In turn,
it will be the characteristics of customers, technology and
application that shape these influences.<p>


<h3>Characteristics</h3>

The occupational profile of employees will drive computing demand.
Professionals devour computing capacity whereas craft labor hardly
uses any. The penetration of computing will also vary. It is extremely
high with engineers and the accounting types, much less with
technicians and sales people. Mobile workers require less computing
than sedentary number crunchers.<p>

Computer literacy also matters.  Employee turnover places enormous
burdens on the support staffs for hand-holding, training, error
correction and equipment relocation. For instance, the Bank
Administration Institute reports a fifty percent turnover rate among
consumer credit officers. That staggering instability must surely
increase the costs of all support.<p>

Technology architecture and adherence to standards also influence
costs. The choice of the identical versions of applications and
operating systems greatly simplifies diagnostics and network
maintenance. Liberal Internet access is a killer, especially on
network capacity. Without central configuration controls over
equipment and software one can easily double the size of the staff at
the help desks. Most importantly, there are enormous economies of
scale in central network administration costs. The statistics of
queuing theory will always favor large networks over small ones.<p>

The failure of application software is perhaps the most severe cause
of all customer dissatisfaction. Some of it comes from poor design,
insufficient testing of maintenance and excessive permissiveness for
local operators to futz around with features and options. Removable
disk drives that allow insertion of private software increase the
workload for everyone. Strict enforcement of security procedures and
controls may cost as much as a thousand dollars per PC per
year.<p>


<h3>Cost management</h3>

Though customer, technology and application characteristics can easily
account for thousands of dollars of additional expense for a PC, it is
poor management that explains most of the difference between low and
high costs. I have no doubt that you do not need technological means
to make up for the differences in the hardware costs between a PC and
an NC. All it takes is for the operators to become reasonably
competent in what they are doing. <p>

Increasingly sophisticated network management systems mean very little
if nobody takes that time and loving care to assist a few chronic
incompetents. Tutoring and assistance must reach beyond technological
fixes to reduce the costs of computing. Customer cost accountability
and activity-based costing for services is essential to offer the
right inducements for cost reduction and continuous quality
improvement.<p>

PC cost management is not doable by going after average costs. One
must first understand the penalty of each of the causes of
counterproductive choice or neglectful practice. That calls for value
engineering, removing one source of expense after another. The
technique for accomplishing that resembles total quality management
more than computer science.<p>

<h3>Implications for CIOs</h3>

Beware of averages. Average travel time does not tell much about
traffic jams. Beware of promised lowering in acquisition costs. The
expenses for a wedding do not tell much about the costs of the
marriage. The size of your medical bills has little to do with your
life expectancy.<p>

My cost-of-ownership model of personal computing now lists thirty
possible PC expense drivers. Each of these can increase the costs of
ownership, if managed poorly. Eliminating causes of dysfunctional
behavior will reduce PC costs if attention concentrates on their
primary causes. There is no such thing as an average cost benchmark
for the cost of PC or NC ownership as there is no average sickness.
The health of PC networks will differ for every firm, since personal
computing reflects the unique characteristics of how a firm manages
its computing well-being.<p>
