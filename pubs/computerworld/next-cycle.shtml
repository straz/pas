<b>Get ready for the re-centralization of information management.</b>
</blockquote><p>

The triumph of the Internet doesn't mean that the decentralization of
business computing is here to stay. Just the opposite will occur: The
Internet's weaknesses will give birth to a new IT era of central network
management and configuration control. When every computer is connected to
everyone and employees are totally dependent on networks to get work done,
executives will insist on strong central controls to contain costs and
deliver expected results.<p>

<h3>Precipitating the crisis</h3>

Today, top executives are being taught many unpleasant lessons about the
total cost of computing.<p>

The year 2000 fiasco is one of them. Corporate management is also learning
that tighter operational discipline will lower the total cost of ownership
of PCs. If the current estimates of a savings of up to $4,000 per PC per
year are roughly correct, CEOs will wonder who was minding the store while
200 million PCs were installed.<p>

Other lessons are yet to come. Companies are now paying to replace
just-installed client/server systems with supposedly faster, cheaper
Internet solutions.<p>

The infatuation with the Internet won't last. Loss of control over data,
incompatible applications and the threat of security corruption will
gradually end business' blind faith in the Internet as an information
management cure-all. Billions spent on Web pages and Internet business
ventures will eventually be wiped out.<p>

These expensive lessons won't sit easily with top executives. They will ask
why so many technology projects abort during implementation or have such a
short lifespan. They will question why IS managers waste money by
abandoning existing investments in hardware, software, data and training
with each generation of new technology.<p>

This time, top management won't be content with more presentations from the
CIO. Short-term thinking and build-and-junk habits have become an
unaffordable luxury. The 1996 IT spending for 3,110 of the largest U.S.
firms now equals their total annual economic value-added. Companies don't
have the money to start yet another massive replacement of systems
investments inherited from prior computer technology cycles.<p>

A backlash against wasteful IT spending will shape the coming technology
cycle. CEOs will impose centralized constraints on all future IT
investments, to make sure they get lasting value.<p>

<h3>The Coming of the "Network Computer" Era</h3>

The need for control of applications, data and security will lead to what I
call the Network Computer era. I don't mean that to be only NC-like client
computing. Network Computing dictates that all computers are just
peripherals that are monitored, configured, maintained, diagnosed,
repaired, upgraded and made secure from centrally managed sites. Such
management practices must rely on high standards for reliability,
responsiveness and safety. Network Computing also enables centrally
administered productivity assessments and remedial training which is
managed and assisted by skilled professionals instead of being left to
local improvisations by amateurs.<p>

The hallmark of this era won't be a particular hardware platform or
operating system. Any microprocessor will be able to run any application,
as long as non-proprietary codes, languages and standards are followed.
With "Pure Java," platform-independent computing, universal network
connectivity and the doctrine of "write once, run anywhere and anytime," I
see for the first time a glimpse that "open systems" technologies could
become a compelling reality.<p>

The economic model of Network Computing will also differ from what we have
now. Vendors, consultants and CIOs concentrate almost exclusively on IT
costs which are defined as what is included in the IT budget. That is a
misjudgment. When one analyzes the Total Costs of Ownership of computers
one finds that most of the costs that affect the productivity of people
show up as operating expenses, not as IT.
(see <a href="http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/cw/downtime.shtml">CW, July 14, 1997, Page 62</a>).
The new economic model must encompass all of the costs of
information-handling, including user costs as well as gains in their
productivity.<p>

The old disputes that drove arguments favoring centralization vs.
decentralization -- whether the central IS or the end-use customers possess
the hardware -- will no longer be relevant when everyone has mainframe
MIPS in their pocket. The principal question will be who manages the rules
of network control. The CIO may not be the key player in that round.
Chances are that the technological complexity, economies of scale and
scarcity of talent will lead companies to outsource most of the network
management tasks. But CIOs will have to make sure that outsourcing doesn't
hand too much power to the contractor, and that the outsourcing agreement
doesn't become a trap.<p>

<h3>CIO Implications</h3>

CIOs must do more than administer technology resources to cope with the new
computer cycle. They must grasp how the demands for increased productivity
escalate as billions of low-cost devices interconnect and international
competition makes everyone a contender for revenues in the global
marketplace.<p>

The job of a CIO will not be limited to management of data processing. In
the new era the scope of that job expands to cover all information-related
business processes. That includes not only the automation of
computationally limited business functions but most information-handling
and information coordination activities. In the network computer world, IT
leaders must cultivate and conserve the most costly and valuable elements
of any system: data, business processes, workflow, work-enlargement, the
enhancement of the employees skills and the protection of knowledge assets.<p>

The squandering of computer resources, which has characterized the history
of computing so far, is finally coming to an end. Long-term economic
benefits, not short-term technology costs, will rule from now on. Whenever
that prevails, the forces of centralization will reassert themselves.<p>
