<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he idea that something is
amiss with IT investments</font> dates back at least 15 years to when
Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow quipped that computers are
everywhere except in the economic statistics. Hence, the productivity
paradox: the inability to convincingly demonstrate that our
investments in technology have resulted in measurable productivity
improvements.<p>

Much has been written about the phenomenon. But nobody has yet offered
a number that would help executives define whether their own company's
productivity paradox is small or large. I'd like to introduce a way. I
call it the IT paradox number, the difference between a firm's actual
computer hardware spending and what Moore's Law would predict it to
be.<p>

Moore's Law states that the number of transistors that can be crammed
into a semiconductor chip doubles every 24 months without increasing
the costs of making it. That means that electronics costs can decline
33.3% annually.<p>

The U.S. Department of Commerce settled on an average decrease in "IT
costs" at a compound annual rate of 17.5%. It applies that number to
economic calculations such as the gross domestic product and the
cost-of-living indicators.<p>

Hence, the formula for calculating one's own IT paradox number: It's
your company's IT budget today, compared with what it could have been
if you had previously bought your computing capacity every year for
17.5% less.<p>

If you're alarmed by your company's paradox number, I can offer some
consolation: You have company.<p>

I have been tracking corporate IT costs for a long time. U.S.
corporate computer hardware costs increased from $67 billion in 1990
to $153 billion last year. If Moore's Law would have delivered to its
full potential, the 1998 IT budgets would have bought $558 billion
worth of computing power. Therefore, the U.S. corporate IT paradox
number now stands at $405 billion, the difference between $558 billion
and $153 billion.<p>

The objections to such a calculation will come from those who claim
that computers now do much more, and therefore the additional spending
is justified.<p>

I'm not so sure. If CIOs can explain to their executive committees
that they delivered 833% more computer-induced business capabilities
($558 billion divided by $67 billion) since 1990, I will gladly
acknowledge that Moore's Law applies not only to semiconductor
manufacturing, but also to IT budgets.<p>

What, then, explains the differences between the potential gains of
Moore's Law and the harsh realities of IT spending?<p>

<ol>
<li><u>Bloated software.</u> Whatever performance gains one gets from
electronics manufacturers is chewed up by software that compensates
for its inadequacies by gobbling up all the computing power it can
get.<p>

<li><u>Excessive support costs.</u> Hardware maintenance and support costs are
included in the reported hardware budgets. The total cost of ownership
of a desktop computer now includes as little as 10% for hardware
depreciation. Most costs are for expensive support labor to keep the
hardware alive and to tranquilize unhappy customers.<p>

<li><u>Negligent systems engineering.</u> Corporate hardware assets
are put in place with hardly any configuration management, safeguards
against early obsolescence or provisions for future growth. The
hardware landscape of most corporations looks to me more like a
shantytown than a metropolis.<p>

</ol>

The consequences of those effects generate the paradox number.
Hardware is acquired and junked for no reason other than IT's
inability to cope with what it already has. What appears as
inexpensive hardware is purchased (or outsourced) as the preferred
solution to the software bloat, uncontrolled support costs and
improvised systems engineering.<p>

The IT paradox number can be calculated by anyone and for any
corporate computer budget. It may be a good idea for a corporate CIO
to know what this number is before some smart chief financial officer
brings it up next time budget cuts are on the agenda. <p>

looking for the one organization that can explain its IT spending by
applying Moore's Law.<p></font>
