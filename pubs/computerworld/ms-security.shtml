<font size="+2">M</font><font size="+1">icrosoft's dominance in
operating systems represents a new threat</font> to the national
security of our information-based society.The government is trying
hard to contain the expanding power of Microsoft by antitrust
litigation that would prove present harm to consumers.  That's
insufficient. The government also should address the risks from
information warfare attacks on a largely homogeneous systems
management environment. Inevitably, infoterrorists and criminals will
take advantage of flaws in the gigantic Microsoft operating systems
that are on their way to becoming the engines for running most of our
information infrastructure.<p>

<h3>Microsoft's Creeping Ambitions</h3>

Microsoft's controlling position in software packages -- the basis on
which most computer networks and software applications exist -- is
best illustrated by the rise of its profits relative to the total
profits of all publicly traded software firms. That advantage has
widened steadily from 23.7% in 1987 to 55.6% in 1997 and is likely to
climb to well over 60% as Microsoft's profit gains keep accelerating.
That trend is ominous because a company's profit relative to all its
competitors is the best measure of its proliferative power and the
competitors' precariousness.<p>

Yet it's the future prospects of a Microsoft-dominated world that
worry me most.<p>

Bill Gates' September memorandum to Microsoft managers outlining the
directions for his company heightened my apprehensions.<p>

Gates talks about how, in the future, companies will store their data
and applications on "megaservers" controlled by Microsoft software.
Companies and users would dial up their Microsoft accounts to obtain
the required software and download information they need from servers
managed by a Microsoft operating system.<p>

To further those ends, Microsoft assembled a Web Essentials team to
explore what central services could be used daily via a Microsoft
portal site. In that way, the megaserver would offer a unifying
"single storage engine." Applications would keep information directly
in a central store instead of their own files.<p>

Thus, Microsoft now sets its sights not only on the control of local
computing, but also on the sources from which all program code and
data originate.<p>

(Although I was unable to obtain a copy of the memo, its contents were
paraphrased in detail to Computerworld by a Microsoft public relations
representative.)<p>

<h3>The Dangers Of Domination</h3>

Upgrading Microsoft software has been a logical choice for customers
who wished to keep up with changes in technology. But the risks of
anintegrated family of operating systems running all U.S. computers --
a declared Microsoft objective -- make selecting a Microsoft platform
more than a purely technical choice. An all-encompassing operating
system bares itself to hostile exploitation of paralyzing security
flaws. The presence of a fatal defect is unavoidable, as the
complexity of Microsoft systems expands to bizarre proportions with
each new release. It's the search for such a fault that occupies the
minds of some of the brightest computer experts. Finding a crack
through which one could induce mayhem with only a few keystrokes would
be worth a great deal of money, especially when supporting an act of
terrorism.<p>

It's only a question of time before the ubiquitous presence of
Microsoft operating systems -- supported by a software-updating
network -- reaches a state of interconnectivity that makes a universal
systems crash feasible. All that will be required is inducement of a
widespread information infrastructure collapse through a deliberately
executed and preplanned act of information warfare.<p>

No agricultural expert would suggest that only one crop, using the
identical seed strain, be planted in Kansas, Ohio, Illinois and Iowa.
"Monocultures," as biologists call them, are just too vulnerable to
pests, disease and an unprecedented combination of ecological
conditions. The Irish potato famine, for example, was caused by
reliance on a single strain of potato.<p>

The risk from a software monoculture has increased because of the
shift from custom-made software to packaged applications residing on
an integrated family of Microsoft operating systems. As a result, the
risks from planned subversion of a software monoculture now overwhelm
the benefits of Microsoft's operating systems dominance. What's at
stake for society is not Microsoft profit but the enormous risk to the
economic viability of all computer-dependent enterprises.<p>

The dispute the Department of Justice has with Microsoft shouldn't be
judged only by antitrust regulations. It should be influenced by the
unprecedented security risks to our information-based civilization.
The safety of our society, not just the fortunes of Sun, Apple or
Netscape, is at stake. The Microsoft defense that the company was only
maximizing profits using common competitive methods is unsupportable.
Business practices that may be tolerable for a small competitor are
perilous when scaled up to security-threatening proportions on a
national scale.<p>

information terrorism at the National Defense University at Fort
McNair in Washington. He doesn't believe that more government
inspectors can reduce software risks. Instead, purchasers of
information technologies should demand insurance-backed warranties
against systems vulnerabilities.
