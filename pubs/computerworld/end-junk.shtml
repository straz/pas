<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he past 50 years of
computing</font> can be seen not only as a fantastic explosion of new
capabilities, but also as a progressive accumulation of costly
software junk. The entire history of computing can be characterized as
an evolutionary -- and increasingly expensive -- sequence of
build-and-destroy cycles. That has to change: We're on the verge of an
intolerably expensive new cycle. But thanks to the options being
offered by outsourcers and software innovators, there's a way to break
the cycle.

<p>With each new computing cycle, much of what had been invested had
to be junked for progress to take place. Consider the following:

<p><ul><li> At the end of the punch-card accounting cycle (about
1958), more than $100 million worth of hard-wired control boards had
no utility.

<p><li> When applications began to be stored on disk memory instead of
magnetic tape (about 1972), more than $5 billion worth of programs had
to be replaced.

<p><li> When minicomputers began shaping the distributed computing
environment (about 1976), as much as $150 billion of software needed a
complete overhaul.

<p><li> The advent of the microcomputer (starting in 1983) saw an
exodus of applications from mainframes and minicomputers to desktops.
More than $650 billion worth of installed software lost value.</ul>

<P>By 1990, the chaotic proliferation of powerful personal computers
had created a control crisis that it was hoped would be cured by
client/server architectures. We have now come to the end of that
cycle, and the pundits tell us that the Internet ande-commerce offer
the magic solution. Be ready to write down about $3 trillion worth of
hard-to-maintain and insecure programs.

<p>That $3 trillion is a significant share of total anticipated
software spending in the next 10 years. With the hardware component of
IT budgets dropping because of falling hardware prices, most of the
world's spending for IT in the next technology cycle will be for
software and software-related costs. With rising IT budgets, that
suggests software spending in the next 10 years of well over $10
trillion. Unfortunately, migration, conversion, integration and
maintenance will absorb most of all software costs if the current,
wasteful practices are allowed to continue.

<p>Executives looking for competitive advantage won't be satisfied
with only a fraction of their total software budget being deployed for
profitable value creation. U.S. executives need rapid innovation, not
expensive preservation of what is becoming an increasingly costly
relic.

<p>Executives have three options. First, they can continue on the
current course of escalating computer budgets and painfully extracting
value-creating applications from whatever funding is left over from
maintaining the systems now in place. Second, they can find
outsourcers that will act as custodians of the junk pile. Third, they
can find technically capable innovators to come up with
technologically advanced solutions at radically lower prices than a
firm could on its own.

<p>The third option is in reach. New software technologies -- such as
Java running in a networking environment, and relying on
processor-independent code -- have life-cycle costs of less than
$1,500 per function point. That's far lower than the comparable
life-cycle cost of more than $4,500 of the current installed base.
(The estimates come from software metrics expert Capers Jones, a
credible source of such data, and my own estimates of code
obsolescence.) Clearly, there's money to be found in managing
softwarelibraries for modernization if you can set up a clever way to
manage that transition.

<p>There will be profit opportunities for the junkyard custodians as
well as for the innovators who can lead us out of the next cycle of
trillion-dollar waste. I'm betting that most companies will wager on
the innovators. There's much more value available from delivering new
profit opportunities than from managing a dying well of assets.

Strassmann (<a href="mailto:paul@strassmann.com">paul@strassmann.com</a>) has managed
his way through every computer cycle because money was always
available to pay for replacements. Unfortunately for current IT
executives, there isn't enough money left to do that again in the next
cycle.</FONT>
