> The effects of knowledge capital on profitability aren't as simple as they may seem.


An article in Fortune this spring ("We're Worth Our Weight in Pentium
Chips," March 20, 2000) used the measure of cost per pound as a way
to show that "manufactured goods increasingly are congealed
brainpower" -- in effect, it tried to explain the worth of knowledge
capital embodied in various products. Such approximations may be
useful in explaining the value of so-called "intangible" goods. They
also may begin to demonstrate that the value of knowledge can reveal
itself only in the form of the price someone is willing to pay for
it. Of course, we should use caution in extending cost-per-pound
metrics too far, as in estimating the knowledge held by a person (such
as one who weighs 350 pounds) or the knowledge contents of a pound of
gem-quality diamonds (1,866 carats) costing $7.2 million.

Nevertheless, I found the cost-per-pound metrics a helpful means to
illuminate the connection between prices, the financial structures of
corporations and knowledge capital. A few examples from the Fortune
article are shown in the table below. I then set out to discover how
to rationalize the enormous disparities in these prices. 

My first approach was to examine differences in labor costs. USX-Steel
has a high ratio of labor to revenues, but General Motors does not and
Intel's is even less. The General Motors case is particularly
telling. By far the largest cost for GM is component purchases (54
percent of revenues); the cost of labor for assembly is small in
relation to the price of a car. Because operating costs do not explain
the differences, I decided to look at the capital accounts. The
structure of capital assets clearly differentiates USX-Steel from GM
and Intel.

The amounts of financial capital employed by these firms vary
dramatically. Intel requires $23.4 billion of financial capital to
deliver its semiconductors. General Motors needs $15.7 billion of
financial capital to deliver millions of cars. Yet USX-Steel needs
only $2.3 billion of financial capital to produce tons of materials
that weigh more than all of the machinery employed by both Intel and
General Motors.

Ultimately, what explains the large differences in prices per pound is
not financial capital but knowledge capital. (Knowledge capital is
computed by dividing economic value added by the interest rate paid
for acquiring the knowledge capital.) Intel's $107.1 billion in KC
exceeds its financial capital and accounts for 76 percent of the total
knowledge capital for all three firms. GM's KC, $33.4 billion,
accounts for 23 percent. USX-Steel possesses only $2.1 billion of KC,
which is less than its financial capital.

These comparisons in capital shed light not only on prices of
information-age products but also on new issues of the information
economy. For instance, a key question concerns the ease of entry and
competitive viability of firms that, in order to compete, depend on a
high ratio of knowledge to financial capital. Is it more desirable to
be a General Motors (with 1998 revenues of $161 billion) or an Intel
(with 1998 revenues of $23.3 billion)?

One way of answering this question is from the shareholder's
standpoint. GM's return on shareholder equity (ROE) has consistently
declined, from 82 percent in 1994 to 17 percent in 1998. In contrast,
Intel's ROE has climbed steadily, from 30 percent in 1994 to 41
percent in 1997.

GM's falling profitability explains why, in keeping with the trend to
associate the prospect of huge gains with things e-related, it is
diversifying into information services. It has issued press statements
announcing that "the world's largest automaker is turning itself into
the world's largest e-commerce company... moving into online
mortgages, communications services and information delivery."

Such pronouncements may be good for public relations, but they have
questionable value in cases, such as GM's own, in which enormous
financial assets dwarf the existing worth of knowledge capital. 

For the time being, a dominant firm (such as Intel) that controls a
large amount of knowledge capital is likely to be more profitable than
a dominant firm (such as USX-Steel or GM) that depends primarily on
financial capital. But such a simplistic view about the "new
economy" could mislead companies into making foolish
investments. Sustaining competitive advantage through ownership of
knowledge capital is a precarious proposition, much more vulnerable
than the ownership of financial assets. I will discuss this issue next
month.
