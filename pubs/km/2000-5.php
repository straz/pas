Discussion of knowledge capital and knowledge assets often is
accompanied by euphoric visions from a new class of futurists whom I
call \"cyber-utopians.\" They 
tout the increased capacity of individuals to accumulate wealth without any of the 
limitations imposed by industrial-age financial capital, such as making profits and 
earning revenues. One of the favorite constructs of the cyber-utopians is to speculate 
about the liberating capacity of the Internet to enable a small organization to operate 
with all of the advantages of a giant enterprise. Accordingly, the Internet can endow 
any entrepreneur with the powers to construct a virtual enterprise that can appear to 
be worth more than established corporations with tens of thousands of workers and 
long histories of delivering products or services. Thus, \"knowledge capital\" can be 
expanded without regard to balance sheets, accountants, bricks-and-mortar offices or 
outlets or physical products. In this view, \"knowledge\" is intangible and therefore 
infinitely inflatable.<p>

In the cyber-economy, according to prophets in publications such as Wired, 
anyone with imagination can take advantage of the new opportunities and grab 
untold wealth that is waiting to be picked up. In this utopia anyone can transcend the 
limitations previously imposed by geography, culture, possession of capital or access 
to special privileges.<p>

It should be obvious that I do not subscribe to this vision of easy opportunity. In 
fact, my research shows that such a dispersal of wealth is illusory.<p>

In a previous column (\"The Importance of Knowledge Capital,\" March 2000 
KMM) I suggested that, despite claims to the contrary, accumulation of Knowledge 
Capital (KC) is more likely to be concentrated than widespread. I want to elaborate 
on this important topic through a few examples that illustrate some current trends.<p>

When we consider the distribution of ownership of Knowledge Capital in the 
United States (among 7,288 publicly traded firms for which such data is available), it 
is surprising how much is held by a relatively few firms.<p>

The total available Knowledge Capital for these firms was $6,412 billion, 
distributed as follows: 84 firms each had KC of more than $20 billion and as a group 
accounted for a total of $5,331 billion; 3,287 firms each had KC of less than $20 
billion and accounted for $3,078 billion total; and 3,916 firms had negative KC (that 
is, they were unable to compensate for their net financial assets at the prevailing 
costs of financial capital), which produced for a negative total of $1,997 billion.<p>

This concentration of capital was reported in 1998 annual reports. In 10 years 
this distribution may be even more constricted. Stock market valuations from 1999 
suggest that investors anticipate only a small number of surviving winners whenever 
the current economic cycle shakes out.<p>

<h3>Survival of the Fattest</h3>

U.S. society favors the \"winner-take-all\" mentality of the information 
technology industry, even though these tendencies have been legislated as un-
American conduct since Teddy Roosevelt was president. \"New economy\" enthusiasts 
find it convenient to overlook such precedents. The profit characteristics of the 
software industry and its dominant firm, Microsoft, illustrate this phenomenon.<p>

The total global software industry profits for 1998 among public companies 
were $12 billion. Microsoft accounted for $7.7 billion of that (and has added reserves 
on top of that). Another 331 firms accounted for a total of $8.9 billion (including 
Oracle, which earned $1.1 billion), and the remaining 380 firms reported losses of 
$4.6 billion. Yet one of the main arguments Microsoft raised in its anti-trust defense 
was a claim that there are thousands of software firms in existence and that entry into 
the software business is easy. To my knowledge nobody contested that argument, 
although it is like a great white shark pleading for endangered wildlife status based 
on the count of salmon in the Columbia River. The Microsoft case is an example of a 
dominant vendor successfully transplanting Knowledge Capital to customers to 
affect their purchasing habits and make them captives.<p>

The examples of trends toward concentration of economic power despite rapidly 
rising technological diversity are numerous. Let me offer just two. The first deals 
with the enormously popular search engines that everyone uses to look for relevant 
information among more than three billion Internet pages. My catalogue shows that 
more than 250 search engine software packages or services are available, and the 
market is growing at the rate of about one per week. Given such variety, one would 
expect diversified usage habits, but that is not the case. In December 1999 one search 
engine - Yahoo - accounted for 56 percent of all Internet referral traffic. The Yahoo 
case is an example of persistence of habits among Internet users, which a successful 
vendor can leverage into market power.<p>

A more potent and possibly farther-reaching economic influence comes from 
the rapid expansion of business-to-business transaction consortia. One can only 
speculate about the effects on prices of industrial components that will result from 
the concentration of purchasing power due to the recently announced 
CommerceOne/Oracle venture. In this offering, four automobile firms - which have 
revenues of $566 billion out of total industry revenues of $1,160 billion - will use 
Internet-based procurement to obtain bids directly from 30,000 firms, without 
intervention by brokers, wholesalers or purchasing departments. The current estimate 
is that this may eliminate as much as $3,000 in costs of a $22,000 vehicle. The 
CommerceOne case is an example of successful implantation of an information 
intermediary to demolish existing institutions that have lost their utility.<p>

In summary, the tendencies toward concentration of economic power, on a 
global scale, are cropping up everywhere. At the moment this trend is being 
overlooked in the rush to make a killing in IPOs of dot-coms that promise to gain 
choice shares of global commerce. These expansionary trends are justified, not 
unlike the promises of sea captains embarking on journeys to the Spice Islands in the 
16th century. Not since the occupation of the New World by the Spanish, the British 
takeover of worldwide colonies or the American land rush has so much wealth been 
available for the taking.<p>

The promises of enormous profits to be made from e-commerce are real. But 
long after the surviving ship captains of the information age have retired to their 
estates, a few imperial fleets will remain to take over and manage colossal 
accumulations of Knowledge Capital with economic power never seen before in 
history.<p>
