<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he value of knowledge capital</font>
has become the financial community's favorite rationalization for the
current stratospheric prices of some stocks. If you probe further and
ask a broker to define "knowledge capital," you are likely to hear
that it is the difference between what investors are willing to pay
and the book value of a firm. </P>

<P>This circular reasoning is sufficiently vague that it seems to
confirm the view that everyone in the U.S. is getting smarter because
the stock market says so. It appeals to newly minted MBAs because it
justifies high salaries and stock options. Gurus, pundits and
intellectuals can then make claims about the priceless value of their
knowledge capital despite the fact that it is not feasible to
determine a valuation that can be verified independently. </P>

<P>There are, however, those who detest the flimsy rationale of
self-serving knowledge capital claimants. It is the job of CFOs,
auditors and accountants to come up with assessments of the worth of a
firm's intangible assets. This is critically important when explaining
the price paid for an acquisition, in granting stock options and in
paying sign-up bonuses for unique talent. It is up to the financial
scorekeepers to rein in exaggerated claims of intangible wealth and
juxtapose reality against fantasy. </P>

<P>So when a recent issue of <I>CFO Magazine</I> - perhaps the most
widely read monthly for senior financial executives - arrived, I
was delighted to see that it tackled, for the first time, the thorny
topic of knowledge capital. The cover proclaimed: "Seeing Is Believing
- A Better Approach To Estimating Knowledge Capital." Indeed, my
excitement was well rewarded. The article was by Baruch Lev, professor
of accounting and finance at New York University. Professor. Lev is
widely respected because of his record as a critic of current
corporate accounting practices. His article was also heralded in the
June 12 edition of <I>The Economist</I> as a major new and
innovative insight into the valuation of knowledge and ideas.</P>

<P>In the article, Lev introduces a simple ratio for determining the
valuation of a firm's knowledge capital. He defines it as "... the
normalized earning minus earnings from tangible and financial assets
divided by knowledge capital discount rate." The significance of Lev's
article is great. In contrast to attempts published by other experts,
which are more akin to judging beauty contests, we finally have before
us a reproducible and independently verifiable calculation. Even more
important is that Lev's concept of "comprehensive value," defined as
the sum of financial capital (e.g. book value) and knowledge capital,
provides a way to determine the worth of corporate knowledge and
ideas.</P>

<P>Though I have some problems with the application of Lev's ratio (to
be discussed in future columns I will be writing), what matters now is
to test the utility of his theories as they apply to current stock
market valuations. If the value of a firm is the sum of its tangible
assets plus its knowledge capital assets, what does Lev's theory tell
us about recent stock market valuations?</P>

<P>The following table is an extract from Lev's calculations as shown in CFO Magazine:</P>

<P>The stock market, as of May 31, 1998 (when the data for the above
table was collected), did not care much about the calculated
estimates. For instance, Merck&#150;with calculated knowledge capital
of about $48 billion and book value of $12.6 billion - had a market
valuation of about $140 billion. Thus the market valuation of
knowledge capital was total market valuation minus book value, more
than $127 billion. That's a 265 percent overvaluation over the
calculated number! Similarly, the market valuations of knowledge
capital for most of the 47 firms listed in the CFO article are much
greater than what Lev suggests.</P>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<P>Indeed, there is such a thing as knowledge capital. Indeed it can
be calculated. If calculated correctly, it could explain why the
purchase cost of most U.S. firms is greater than their book value
("carcass value") that accountants attribute to it as a generally
accepted practice. As much as Professor Lev deserves our thanks and
appreciation for opening a discourse on placing a dollar value on
knowledge capital, his formula still does not reflect the valuations
that the market places on firms. Stocks are either enormously
overpriced or the knowledge capital, according to the Lev's ratio, is
vastly under-priced.</P>

<P>I do not believe that the marketplace awards unreasonably excessive
premiums to the valuation of corporate assets. A valuation bubble here
and there has been always present, but that observation is not useful.
This gets us back to the question whether one can arrive at the
valuations of knowledge capital that are independent of any
manic/depressive phenomena on the stock exchanges or the mumbo-jumbo
of arbitrarily weighted multi-factor indicators. Professor Lev says
that is possible, and I agree. However, we may have to sharpen our
analytic methods to make the differences between theory and reality
reproducible and verifiable. That's what the follow-on articles in
this series will explore. </P>
