<p><b>Despite crude correlations, forget about using stock market valuation as a knowledge management metric

<p>By Paul Strassmann</b>

<p><img src="pas.gif" align=right>

<p> Formal methods of knowledge capital valuation make it possible to
assess whether the stock market does or does not make a good estimate
of a firm's knowledge capital. By comparing the market value (as
quoted on stock exchanges) with the valuation of knowledge capital (as
calculated from actual economic results), we can judge whether the
marketplace is a reliable indicator. <p>

As a reminder, one can compute the knowledge capital of a firm by
taking a year's worth of economic value-added&#151;the financial
returns from assets that do not show up in financial reports (see
"Calculating Knowledge Capital," Oct. `99 KMM). Using this approach, I
was able to show that Abbott Laboratories had steadily grown its
knowledge capital from $8.2 billion in 1991 to $39.5 billion in 1998
(a 382 percent growth). Meanwhile, financial capital grew from $3.2
billion in 1991 to $5.7 billion in 1998 (a 78 percent growth).
Clearly, Abbott Laboratories enjoyed a period of substantial growth in
its assets. <p>

The question before us is, how did all this growth get reflected in
the prices of shares? Did the stock market recognize that much of the
worth of Abbott Laboratories was in intangibles, or did it look more
favorably on the accumulation of financial assets counted by the
accountants, as reflected in reports to shareholders? To answer this
question, let us examine eight years of recent history at Abbott
Laboratories.<p>


<p><a href="tickertape2b.gif" target=CHILD><img src="tickertape2a.gif" align=right></a>

What we see is a pattern of investors either premium-pricing or
discount-pricing shares of Abbott Laboratories. From 1992 through
1996, the market appears to have reflected the uncertainty over
regulatory interventions into the pricing of pharmaceuticals and
medical services. After 1996, that depressing effect seems to
disappear. <p>

Particularly noteworthy is the significant disparity between market
value and the calculated capitalization in 1998. I call this
difference the market premium indicator, which at year-end of 1998
stood at +64 percent. The market also discounted the value of
knowledge capital by -18, -19, -9 and &#151;14 percent from 1993
through 1996. Since the financial capital during that period kept
increasing, the conclusion must be that shareholders discounted the
value of people, patents, brand names and market share for a four-year
period. <p>


<p><a href="tickertape3b.gif" target=CHILD><img src="tickertape3a.gif" align=right></a>

With the facility to estimate the premiums or the discounts from stock
market valuations for an entire industrial sector, one can show how
similar firms fared in the investor's perceptions of their
knowledge-based assets. The table shows the stock market assessment of
the worth of the knowledge capital for major pharmaceutical firms.<p>

The large year-to-year gyrations in the stock market valuations
suggest that adopting stock market prices as an indicator of a firm's
gain or loss in knowledge capital is too volatile to be of practical
use in planning knowledge management programs. As I will show in
future articles, investments in knowledge capital must be assessed
independently of the ups and downs of the stock market. However, the
knowledge capital metrics should maintain a realistic link with the
world of finance, but that is better accomplished by watching a firm's
valuation of its capital assets.<p>

In the case of a firm that has an established earning record, a high
stock market valuation does not explain its knowledge capital in any
instant moment. In the case of start-up businesses, a high
stock-market valuation should not become a verifiable claim about the
possession of knowledge capital. If you seek trustworthy and
reproducible metrics by which to steer investments into knowledge
management projects, it is better to watch the bottom line, than the
ticker tape.  <p>
