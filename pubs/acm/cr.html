<b><font size="+1">The main targets</font></b> of
Strassmann's unmasking of misconceptions about business use of
computers include advocates of "best practices" and the mouthpieces of
computing vendors. <p>

While this is not a particularly angry
polemic, Strassmann is all the more devastating for his 
understated and straightforward marshalling of basic
facts. His intended audiences are the executives, 
managers and chief information officers responsible for
developing, maintaining and managing enterprise computer
resources.<p>

The book is nicely prepared. A separate list of recommendations
at the end summarizes the author's advice to CIOs. 
Clever and insightful sayings, with which each chapter begins, are
collected in a separate section. <p>

At times, Strassmann may seem like a voice crying
in the information wilderness. However, given his
credentials, his simple and powerful style of writing derived
from  significant knowledge will probably provide
tomorrow's management gospel. One can only hope
people really read him this time.<p>
