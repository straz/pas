<hr>
<font size="+1">Indiscriminate discarding of knowledge assets</font>,
whether in the form of accumulated employee training or legacy
software, has origins in ideas proposed over a century ago about the
value of capital and labor.

<p>These theories claim that only capital assets increased the productivity of
labor. Consequently, the productivity of an enterprise is measured only in
terms of the productivity of its capital, such as Return-on-Assets or
Return-on-Investment.  The providers of capital are then entitled to the
surplus, called profit or rent.  If knowledge happens to be necessary for
labor to make better uses of capital, that becomes the justification for a
higher wage rate for labor.  By this reasoning, those performing the actual
labor are not entitled to collect rent from the knowledge they have
accumulated.  Labor can receive only fair compensation for the time worked. 
The most they are allowed to claim is to be awarded premium wages and a
bonus here or there.

<p>The above reasoning is not only misleading, but results in judging the
value of employees on the basis of their wages, rather than how fast they
accumulate useful knowledge.  The productivity of labor is not only a matter
of wages. Productivity comes from knowledge capital aggregated in the
employee's head in the form of useful training and company-relevant
experience.

<h3>The Individual's Point of View</h3>

<p>Let me illustrate this by an example.  You hire an untrained person who
meets entry level requirements, such as literacy, a work ethic and socially
acceptable behavior traits. His or her wage will be based on prevailing wage
rates for entry level skills. Ten years later, that person becomes a manager
or expert, earning three times the entry level wages. How does a firm
justify spending three times more on the identical person?

<p>The accumulation of company-specific knowledge explains the difference.
During those ten years, the organization invested anywhere from a year's to
several years of salary in helping the employee to function more
effectively.  Hardly any of that expense shows up as a direct cost.  Most of
it is in the form of attending meetings, having phone conversations, keeping
up with company gossip and making errors which, if corrected, can be charged
to learning. None of that contributes to anything the customer is willing to
pay for.  Industrial engineers call such expense "overhead."  I call it
money spent on an accumulation of company-specific knowledge capital.  If
organizations spend their money well, employees with ten years of
accumulated knowledge will be worth more than what the company pays them. In
that way, the company will be recovering the investment on its knowledge
capital as incremental profits.

<p>Let us look at the same situation from the standpoint of the employee. To
increase his earning capacity, the employee counts on the company investing
in developing his skills beyond whatever investments he makes on his own,
such as reading books, attending courses and involvement in professional
activities.  However, working for the company consumes most of the time
available to do this.  The best way of raising one's earning potential is to
enhance what shows up on the resume as experience that is not
company-specific.  It would  then be desirable for a person to acquire
marketable knowledge that has greater value than his compensation.  If that
happens, employees will be able to recover their investments in knowledge by
getting promoted to higher paying positions.  If that does not happen, they
can hope to find better paying employment elsewhere.  They can then collect
incremental profits on their knowledge assets in the form of the difference
in the wage rate they could not get from their current employer.

<p>If you replace the word "software" wherever the word "knowledge" was
used above, you will find the statements to hold true except that open
systems software will increase the capacity for knowledge accumulation at a
faster rate, whether seen from the standpoint of the firm or the employee. 
If a corporation's investment in people increases the value of people faster
than their salaries, everybody gains. The corporation creates employee value
added. The employee acquires knowledge capital on which he can collect added
income.

<p>Tragedy occurs when none of the above works out.  This takes place when
the corporation practices and teaches obsolete skills. Then the employee is
not marketable, except at depressed wages. The recent waves of layoffs from
"re-engineering" have not increased unemployment among information workers. 
They find other jobs, but with lower compensation.  An aerospace engineer
could end up as a manager of a copy shop, working 30% longer hours for 40%
less. It is possible to calculate the "fair" price for the new compensation
by writing off the engineer's accumulated knowledge capital in aerodynamics
and structural design to zero.

<p>The cost to develop information workers, which I define as an overhead
expense for acquiring company-specific knowledge, is very often much greater
than the depreciation of the fixed assets and greater than profits for most
corporations. The time has come for enterprises to manage knowledge capital
as perhaps their most significant asset.

<p>The marketable knowledge an information worker acquires during his lifetime
is the only means to increase his earnings.  The potential lifetime earning
capacity of a recently graduated engineer, with a starting salary of $40,000
and real income growing at 4% per annum, is $6 million. Without the added
value, from continually acquired knowledge, the lifetime earnings would be
67% less.  This explains why it is necessary for individual information
workers to start managing their own knowledge capital for maximum returns to
themselves as well as to their employers.

<h3>The Corporate Point of View</h3>

<p>The calculation of the Economic Value-Added makes it possible to count the
worth of the people who possess the accumulated knowledge about a company.
These are the carriers of Knowledge Capital&reg;. They are the people who
leave the workplace every night and may never return while storing in their
heads knowledge acquired while receiving full pay.

<p>They possess something for which they have spent untold hours listening and
talking while delivering nothing of tangible value to paying customers. 
Their brains have become repositories of an accumulation of insights on how
"things work here" - something that is often labeled by the vague expression
"company culture."  Their heads carry a share of the company's Knowledge
Capital, which makes them a shareholder of the most important asset a firm
owns even though it never shows up on any financial reports.  Every such
shareholder of knowledge assets in fact becomes a manager, because
information acquisition and information utilization is the essence of all
managerial acts.

<p>The term "management" is used here as applicable to every information
activity that is not directly engaged in the generation of revenues.  I
define customers as the people from whom you collect cash. When some
corporate staff unit declares that it caters to other staffers as
"customers", that is just a misnomer.  They are overhead and therefore
remain a part of "management" regardless of their claims.			If a newly
hired factory worker spends half a day in general orientation and
indoctrination meetings that means he partakes in a managerial activity. 
The work of an executive secretary can be also seen as managerial, since
this job involves information gathering, storage and dissemination tasks. 
Meetings, training, consultations, giving advice, accounting,
administration, interviewing or correcting quality defects by this
definition are all managerial functions because if they would be fully
accounted for, they would be charged to "overhead" and not to direct costs
of sales. 

<p>In a typical company an average employee spends at least one third of his
time acquiring intra-company information that is unrelated to the delivery
of goods or services. Employees in managerial and staff positions expend all
of their time on tasks not directly related to the delivery of goods or
services. More than 25% of payroll dollars in a knowledge-intensive
enterprise, and well over 50% of the payroll dollars in most government
agencies, are expended on information activities that should be recorded as
managerial overhead.

<p>This learning and talking and listening are expensive. They reduce
corporate profits. But if that accumulation is ultimately convertible in
greater productivity for the enterprise, then the expense was worth it by
earning a return on the Knowledge Capital investment.

<p>Consider the costs of managerial knowledge accumulated by an employee over
a ten-year period. With full costs of employment at about $60,000 per annum,
the decade-long exposure to managerial information would result in knowledge
inputs costing about $150,000. What would be then the measurable outputs
from all of that accumulated knowledge?

>Calculating Knowledge Capital

<p>The Economic Value-Added has been previously shown as the net result of all
managerial activities. Economic Value-Added is the net surplus economic
value created by the firm, since the suppliers, the tax authorities, all
labor, and all shareholder expenses are already fully accounted for.

<p>The creation of Economic Value-Added is something that defies the laws of
conservation of energy.  These laws state that output of any system in the
Universe can never be greater than its input.  Delivering a positive
Economic Value-Added must be therefore an act of creativity that springs
forth from something that is intangible, as if it were an artistic
conception. The source of this creative energy is Knowledge Capital. This
ephemeral element can be quantified only indirectly by observing how much
Economic Value-Added it yields.

<p>Another way of looking at the same phenomenon is to infer the value of
Knowledge Capital from its periodic yield.  If Economic Value-Added is the
interest earned from an accumulation of knowledge residing with the firm,
then the value of this principal can be calculated by dividing the Economic
Value-Added by the price one pays for such capital.

<p>Mergers and acquisitions of companies have made the pricing of all capital
explicit.  The Standard & Poor's 500 companies, which account for
approximately seventy percent of the value of all publicly traded U.S.
companies had fixed assets worth an estimated $1.2 trillion at year-end
1995, while showing a market value of $4.6 trillion. This suggests that
there are intangible assets, generally acknowledged to be the knowledge
assets of a firm, approaching $3.4 trillion that need a better understanding.

<h3>Valuation Attempts</h3>

<p>Over the last two decades numerous attempts have been made to find ways to
reflect intangible knowledge assets on financial reports.  Perhaps the best
known firm that publishes supplemental financial reports on its intangible
assets is Sweden's Skandia Insurance Company.  It accounts for its
intellectual capital by documenting assets not recognized by generally
accepted accounting practices.  This is accomplished by issuing a
supplementary report unconnected with the official financial statement.  The
supplement includes a valuation of its computer systems, experience with
work processes, trademarks, customer lists and an assessment of employee
competence.

<p>Unfortunately, the attempts to assign a valuation to software assets,
trademarks, experience and employee know-how have run so far into the
difficult problem of pricing such assets. It is now widely understood that
the costs of acquiring knowledge and the profit-generation potentials of
such knowledge are unrelated.  The value of intellectual property is in its
use, not in its costs.  This means that they are only worth what a customer
is willing to pay for.

<p>Two movies made with the identical actors, for the same $50 million budget,
will have totally different valuations depending on whether the audiences
like one but not the other. The same applies to software, new ventures,
inventions and employee training. This is why numerous attempts that have
been made to report the intellectual properties of a firm on its balance
sheet have faltered.

<p>Knowledge assets become reflected in the financial accounts only after
there is a merger or acquisition at substantial premiums over book value. 
When that happens, it becomes identified by a non-descriptive phrase
allowance for good will.  Thereupon it becomes subject to depreciation
accounting exactly as if it were tangible equipment.

<p>It seems to me that if companies were allowed to record their knowledge
capital in the valuation of their shareholder equity as a matter of
accounting routine, many of the inconsistencies which currently show up in
accounting and tax treatment of company valuation would vanish.
>
>Pricing Knowledge Capital

<p>It is the risk-adjusted interest in future earnings, in excess of the cost
of capital, which an investor is willing to pay for as the value of any
intangible assets. Since investors cannot differentiate between the price of
capital for financial or knowledge investments because they are
intermingled, I use the identical price for all capital as a first
approximation. This yields a simple equation:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge Capital = Economic Value-Added / Price of Capital<p>


<p>This relation makes it possible to prepare a revised Balance Sheet for any
firm, by adding a line item Knowledge Capital on the Asset side of the
ledger, and by increasing (or decreasing) the reported valuation of
Shareholder Equity by the identical amount.

<h3>Abbott Laboratories</h3>

<p>Abbott Laboratories is an example of a company that has successfully kept
accumulating Knowledge Capital faster than Equity Capital.  It has a stock
market valuation that is a large multiple of its financial assets.  The
earning capacity of Abbott Laboratories and its productivity is gaining not
because it is hoarding financial assets, but because it is using the
capabilities of employees more effectively.
     A great deal of investment analysis is concerned with indicators such
as the Market-to-Book ratios, where the term Book Value refers to the
Shareholder Equity.  Stocks are overvalued if the Market Value of shares
rises materially above a trend line for the Book Values. However, if one
adds the valuation of Knowledge Capital to the valuation of Equity Capital,
the market valuation of a firm such as Abbott Laboratories will turn out to
be not only consistent over an extended time period, but also rationally
explainable.

<p>I have analyzed a number of corporations using this method and find that
adding Knowledge Capital to book value Equity Capital shows a good
correlation with the prices investors are willing to pay for shares of
knowledge-intensive enterprises.
>
>Growing Knowledge Capital
>      One can view Knowledge Capital as the result of a stream of expenses
that have aided an organization to become more effective over a period of
many years. Meetings are not necessarily wasted, because they may contribute
to greater employee awareness. Training is useful if it is put to good use
by making it possible to reach higher levels of quality and productivity.
Software can become immortal if it is not discarded, but reused over and
over again.

<p>Almost everything that counts as an accumulation of knowledge is usually
paid for and written off as an overhead expense and charged against current
profits. This decreases profits, increases expenses and diminishes
Information Productivity unless management sets out deliberately to treat
all overhead expense as a potential investment in Knowledge Capital. Every
manager should therefore monitor what portion of its Sales, General &
Administrative plus Research & Development expense is frittered away as a
one-time happening and how much of it can be seen as an asset with a
residual value.

<p>In the case of Abbott Laboratories, that is an important question since
more than a half of its stock value is derived from its gains in Knowledge
Capital. The answer can be found in computing the firm's Overhead-to-Asset
Conversion Efficiency.

<p>From 1992 through 1997 the cumulative sum of all Sales, General &
Administrative expenses for Abbott Laboratories increased by $16.8 billion.
During that period Knowledge Capital has grown by $31.8 billion.  This then
defines the Overhead-to-Asset Conversion Efficiency as 189%.  It means that
all of the overhead expenses have been expended for the benefit of long-term
utility and at the same time created greater value-added than cost.  (A way
of displaying this steady trend is shown in the chart on this page.)

<p>Abbott Laboratories has succeeded in generating Knowledge Capital faster
than its S.G.&A. plus R&D expenses.  This firm is highly profitable because
its accumulated knowledge can be reapplied without further expense.  Its
current S.G.&A. plus R&D is indeed lower than most of its competitors,
because the company does not have to pay for all of it in every fiscal year.
It re-cycles S.G.&A. plus R&D at a very low cost, which saves on expenses
and increases the value of each employee.  This is why Knowledge Recycling
may become the next management buzzword.  Much of the attraction of the
recently introduced Java language may have its origins in the general
perception that elements of all computer applications should be reusable by
making them capable of running on any computer, on any operating system in
any network environment.

<p>I have analyzed the Overhead-to-Asset Conversion Efficiency of hundreds of
companies and found that a surprising number of companies suffer from
negative conversion efficiency. As they cut S.G.&A. and R&D during
re-engineering, their long-term Information Productivity&reg; declines because
their attrition of Knowledge Capital proceeds at a faster rate than the
savings generated from wholesale dismissals of people.  There seems to be a
trade-off between indiscriminate cost cutting and the demoralization of
valuable employees that leads to a suicidal death spiral.

<p>One of the most efficient instances of Overhead-to-Asset Conversion
Efficiency is  Microsoft Corp. In the period from 1986 through 1995 it
gained $8.3 billion in Knowledge Capital while expending only $10.5 billion
for S.G.&A. plus R&D.  To explain Microsoft's extraordinary
Overhead-to-Asset Conversion Efficiency of 79% one has to understand that
Knowledge Capital does not need to reside exclusively in the heads of
employees.  It also occupies the mind-share of customers who have expended
their own time and money to became habituated to Microsoft products. 

<h3>Software as Knowledge Capital</h3>

<p>Over 40% of all computer budgets is expended on software "maintenance."
This involves continuous refurbishing of old programs.  It consumes large
amounts of money to repair poorly designed and badly organized translations
of business processes into software code.

<p>An additional 10% of all computer budgets is expended on new projects. A
close examination of proposals will show that much of the financial
justification for starting anew is to reduce expenditures for maintenance. 
If someone would try to sell a house that requires an annual upkeep equal to
a half of the purchase price, nobody would buy it.  A rapidly deteriorating
capital asset is not worth much.  Yet, the very high ratio of life-cycle
maintenance costs to the original acquisition cost demonstrates that today's
application software is one of the flimsiest artifacts that management will
ever buy.

<p>The idea of constructing software to qualify as a high-residual
value, low-maintenance capital asset has never been accepted.  According to
Prof. Howard Rubin "...if CIOs were judged the way CFOs are, they would be
in big trouble because they do not know what are their assets." In a survey
of 2,000 firms, 80% had no idea of the size and quality of their software
portfolio.  Which means that a big part of the millions of lines of code
they own are poorly utilized. It is clear that software managers do not have
the incentives to invest in an architecture that is durable in the long run.
The computer people, the vendors and the consultants also prefer whatever
is new, fashionable and quick.

<p>The reason for the flimsiness of the application software can be found in
the lack of understanding by most executives that software has become an
increasingly significant store of a corporation's Knowledge Capital.  While
a comptroller may question the reasons for getting rid of old forklift
trucks, when it comes to software it will be written off without any
examination as to its reuse.  Software expenses are now wasted because
management uncritically accepts the view that software is largely
unrecoverable every time technology, organization or business practices
suffer from major changes.

<p>The existing methods of accounting do not recognize that for most
corporations the accumulation of expenditures for software over a ten-year
period will exceed the value of Shareholder Equity in about 30% of cases. 
As long as software is treated as an expense that must realize short-term
returns, corporations will be paying for software that performs similar
business functions many times over without the benefit of any reuse.

<p>Software asset management is perhaps one of the most exciting new
opportunities for accelerating the accumulation of Knowledge Capital because
it represents an encapsulation of accumulated expert knowledge that can be
purchased in the open market at a fraction of its original cost.

<p>Software should be seen as one of the best means for accumulating and
preserving an enormous amount of information about the ways a corporation
functions. It should be recognized as a knowledge asset so that it can be
managed as something that keeps growing in value steadily, reliably and
safely.  It must be designed for evolutionary growth instead of keeping it
alive by patching it up until such time when a sudden convulsion makes it
necessary to replace it without much delay.

<p>Management must insist that applications software be preserved by means of
technical designs that accommodate rapid changes in computer technologies. 
Management should demand delivery of software applications that take
advantage of innovations in operating systems,  adapt to revisions in
organization structure and take advantage of any streamlining of business
practices

<h3>Key Insights</h3>

<p>If a company scraps 100 forklift trucks before they are depreciated, that
will be recorded as a loss.  If 1,000 employees with career-life learning
costs of at least $150 million leave a corporation, none of the financial
reports will reflect that.  When knowledgeable employees leave, they are
written off as having no value even though during their years of employment
the corporation paid for all of the knowledge they acquired on the job.

<p>The existing methods and concepts of accounting, budgeting and planning are
biased against anything that is not a tangible asset.  No wonder that many
prior attempts to calculate the productivity of "information" have foundered
on the reluctance of the current stakeholders to be subjected to the sort of
measurements that were previously reserved only for the laboring classes.

<p>The reasons for the preservation of accounting methods that were suitable
for the industrial era is for students of corporate power politics to
debate.  It should suffice to remind us that when industrialization induced
a shift from the extraction of funds from feudal land possessions to earning
profits on invested capital, most of the assumptions about how to measure
performance had to change.

<p>When the expenses for acquiring information capabilities cease to be
an arbitrary budget allocation and become the means for gaining Knowledge
Capital, much of what is presently accepted as management of information
will have to shift from a largely technological view of efficiency to an
asset management perspective.

<p>Analysis of corporate financial statements now shows conclusively that
effective information management could have a greater impact on overall
corporate performance than efficient financial management.  

<p>The two hundred years of the dominance of financial capital in the
corporate world is now history. The era of information and knowledge
management has arrived. The information age is now a reality, because it can
now be planned, budgeted and controlled as a corporate input and not merely
as a technology investment.

<p>Knowledge-based strategies cannot be developed unless they are linked to
measures of performance, yet traditional financial indicators offer little
help in this regard. It was the dependency on traditional capital-efficiency
based measures of performance that explains why information finds
practically no place among the typical performance metrics that are examined
by corporate executives, auditors and investors. 

<p>Yet, accumulations of information and knowledge are implicitly
recognized every day when companies are bought at a large multiple of their
financial valuation.  What's missing is a way of making information and
knowledge an explicit measure of performance.  Time has come for those
responsible for "information management" to rise to the challenge of placing
the management of Knowledge Capital high on the agenda of every organization.
