*FAIRFAX, Va.* — Paul Strassmann, a 35-year resident of New Canaan and
 recognized by the U.S. Department of Defense for his work in
 advancing the government’s information capabilities, is being awarded
 an honorary doctorate of humane letters by George Mason University at
 the institution’s 2009 commencement ceremony on May 16.

A native of Czechoslovakia, Strassmann is being honored by Mason for his years of outstanding public service. Presently, he is a member of the Mason faculty as a distinguished professor of information sciences.

With an enrollment of more than 31,000 students, Mason’s class of 2009 totals more than 7,000 students. The university will be awarding more than 4,000 bachelor’s degrees, 2,500 master’s degrees, nearly 240 law degrees and nearly 240 doctorates. 

“Our institution is proud of have Paul Strassmann as part of our academic community. His colleagues and students benefit greatly from his scholastic insight and wisdom,” says university President Alan G. Merten. “The honorary degree we will be awarding him serves as a salute to his stature and professional achievement.”

After serving as a guerilla soldier in his homeland during World War II, Strassmann came to the United States in 1948 to seek an education. He earned his undergraduate degree in engineering from Cooper Union (N.Y.) and his master’s degree in industrial management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

Strassmann began his career in 1961 as corporate information officer at General Foods Corporation and later as the chief information systems executive at Kraft Corporation. In 1969, Strassmann joined Xerox as the director of administration and information systems with worldwide responsibility for all internal Xerox computer activities. Until his retirement from Xerox, he served as vice president of strategic planning for the information products group, with responsibility for strategic investments, acquisitions and product plans involving the corporation's world-wide electronic businesses.

Strassmann’s career did not end at Xerox, however. In 1989, he was appointed as the first senior executive with responsibilities for enterprise-wide computer automation in the office of the Secretary of Defense. He also was appointed to the position of director of defense information. In this role he was responsible for organizing and managing the corporate information management program across the Department of Defense which included a $35 billion cost reduction and business reengineering program of the defense information infrastructure. For this work he received the Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service—the Defense Department's highest civilian recognition.

Subsequently, Strassmann was asked to join NASA as the chief information officer, eventually receiving the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. 

Currently, Strassmann is president of The Information Economics Press and is senior advisor to the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). He serves on the Board of Editors of the Information Economics Journal and on the Board of Visitors, School of Information Studies at Syracuse University.
