Department of Defense (DoD) Business Mission Area (BMA) accounts for
roughly half of the DoD Information Technology (IT) budget. Many of the
DoD&#8217;s business systems have been in use for years and are straining to
support the agility of business operations necessary today. As well,
many new systems are being developed on such a scale that it takes
nearly a decade to produce the first results. A potential answer to
this situation is delivering business capabilities through a
service-oriented architecture (SOA)<sup xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">1</sup>.
Much of the private sector is rapidly moving in this direction. The
question is, will it work for the DoD? This article is about the
results of market research conducted by the BMA Chief Technical Officer
(CTO) and Chief Architect (CA) over a period of about six months to
learn about state-of-the-art SOA and what the DoD can count on from SOA
vendors to deliver both business services and SOA infrastructure in the
near- to mid-term.</span><hr>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
DoD is perhaps the largest and most complex organization in the world,
employing nearly 1.4 million people and holding approximately $1.4
trillion in assets. IT spending for business support activities in the
DoD BMA&#8212;funds to operate, maintain, and modernize business
systems&#8212;comprise $15.7 billion of annual DoD IT spending, roughly equal
to the rest of the federal government.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">While
the DoD has long been acknowledged for its premier warfighting
capabilities, fragmentation of financial and business management
practices leaves the DoD vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well
as risk of failure on attempts to build larger, more complex systems.
To support the DoD mission and the changing nature of the threats to
which the federal government must respond, the DoD BMA is engaged in a
massive business transformation. It must modernize and become agile in
order to support 21st century national security requirements. The BMA
CTO evaluated DoD BMA enterprise processes and associated
systems&#8212;including human resource and personnel management, supply
chain, and logistics, as well as financial and accounting management
functions&#8212;to determine the best strategy for achieving agility. After
analysis and assessment of BMA objectives and study of the overall
direction for IT within the DoD, the strategy selected to move the BMA
forward is the adoption of an SOA.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
U.S. Government Accountability Office describes an SOA as an &#8220;approach
for sharing functions and applications across an organization by
designing them as discrete, reusable, business-oriented services&#8221; [1].
Most importantly, an SOA is a mechanism by which business capabilities
can be aligned with the technical infrastructure in support of an agile
business strategy. The DoD&#8217;s SOA vision calls for such alignment
through an architecture of discrete components called<i> services </i>delivering
business capabilities deployed in a supportive infrastructure designed
for this purpose. The Office of the BMA CTO and CA collaborated with
the chief information officers (CIOs) representing the military
services, defense agencies, combatant commands, mission areas, and DoD
Enterprise Services to develop an SOA strategy, including a supporting
environment termed the Business Operating Environment (BOE). The BOE
leverages industry best practices to federate technical architectures,
develop capability requirements, and support the delivery of portfolios
of business capabilities based on collections of atomic and/or
composite service orchestrations. The BOE is defined in [2], which
details the infrastructure component of the BOE and the business
transformation infrastructure (BTI), shown in Figure 1. Some functions
of the BTI will be met through and built upon the DoD Global
Information Grid Enterprise Services. The technical core of the BTI,
designated the Business Transformation Engine (BTE), is to be built
from commercially available products.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">To
assess the feasibility of this strategy, the BMA CTO conducted market
research into maturity and readiness to support this strategy in SOA
technologies from more than 30 organizations. These had survived a
preliminary screening to ensure that they were realistic and relevant.
The technical research included all components of the BTE, and was
conducted in accordance with departmental regulations guiding
pre-acquisition market research. The organizations provided live
demonstrations of their development, test, operational, and production
environments. CIO offices from each military service and many defense
agencies were invited to attend and participate in the presentations.
This article provides research conclusions across the BTE components
(numbered in Figure 1), as well as SOA information assurance and
governance.</p>

			</p><span class="ctSectionTitle">Industry Readiness to Support Key BTI Capabilities</span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
research approach gathered data to correspond to key technical
capabilities required to build the BTI and included an assessment of
the industry&#8217;s maturity in providing tools to support these technical
capabilities. The research did not consider SOA technologies not
relevant to the BTI. In this section, we present the assessment.</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Interoperability Controller </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
interoperability controller component of the BTI is a pattern or
foundation architecture for brokering, routing, and processing messages
and service invocations within an SOA. It consists of an extensible set
of integration brokers interconnected on the network by robust
messaging middleware. The research looked at products supporting this
pattern, examining them for a number of characteristics, including
support for indirection and interception, loose coupling, scalability,
and robustness. In general, the products that most closely support this
pattern are enterprise service bus (ESB) products, as well as
enterprise application integration and message-oriented middleware
through composition.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
market research shows that the state of industry products as reasonably
mature and can support the implementation of the BMA vision for the
BTI&#8217;s interoperability controller component. The message-oriented
middleware and enterprise application integration product vendors have
been working in this direction through many generations of products.
The ESB vendors have built on this experience to provide an
enterprise-wide solution, though often with proprietary features. The
challenge with the latter is to build a standards-based SOA that
leverages the success of Web technologies rather than an ESB-based
solution that provides some aspects of SOA but could lead to
over-dependence on a particular vendor&#8217;s technology.</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Mediation &#8211; Standard and High Volume </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">While
increasingly more BMA systems and data sources will communicate
natively in terms of standard message sets and vocabularies, there is a
short-term need for mediation of information exchanges, translating,
and transforming messages between information providers and consumers.
The research found good support of this pattern in both the standard
and high-volume variations. Many vendors, (such as Fiorano, BEA
Systems, IBM, Iona, Tibco, and webMethods) are producing capable
transformation engines, especially those focused on eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) messaging and the use of Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformation engines. For high volume, Ab Initio, with its advanced
parallel processing capabilities, allows for the development of
high-performance, straight-through mediation services. However, the
vision for dynamic generation of transformations on a semantic
mediation basis was found to still be a future capability. The semantic
technology needed is immature, so semantic tools from companies like
Revelytix and IBM are best suited for supporting development time
activities, with semantics being early-bound into runtime environments.</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Service Discovery and Metadata Registries </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
BMA&#8217;s approach to SOA calls for metadata registries and repositories
supporting the discovery of services and information assets. DoD
registries are built around Organization for the Advancement of
Structured Information standards, such as Universal Description and
Discovery Interface (UDDI) and electronic business XML (ebXML) Registry
Information Model and Registry Services (including a UDDI service
registry), a Metadata Registry that contains the DoD&#8217;s structural and
semantic metadata, and an enterprise catalog containing DoD
specification metadata to support discovery of information assets.
Given the DoD&#8217;s size and the likely need to federate registries, the
BMA included this category in the market research.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">Many
of the vendors in the market research provide UDDI service registries,
notably Systinet, now a part of HP. Many vendors include UDDI
capability (e.g., IBM, BEA, Software AG), with a number of vendors
using Systinet. Many vendors also include metadata management
capabilities and repository components (e.g., Fiorano, Lombardi), while
others such as Revelytix specialize around semantic metadata. The DoD&#8217;s
metadata discovery specification is not directly supported by vendors,
though those that support the ebXML architecture can act as enterprise
catalog instances.</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Business Activity Monitoring </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">Business
activity monitoring (BAM) allows management of an SOA in business
terms. Market research found that BAM is still in early development.
There are many vendors providing BAM functionality coming from diverse
industry segments. Application integration and enterprise software
vendors (BEA, Fiorano, IBM, IONA Technologies, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP,
TIBCO, web-Methods, etc.) are extending existing assets and acquiring
additional capabilities in order to support BAM. Business intelligence
vendors (Business Objects, Cognos, Software AG, etc.) are working to
adapt technology and incorporate business rules engines into their
solutions to support real-time BAM operations. There is also a set of
pure-play BAM providers who focus on complete BAM solutions. Overall,
the research found little standardization across vendor
implementations, making true interoperability difficult to achieve on
an enterprise level. The most common uses found in the research revolve
more around project-based, application-specific uses rather than as
general enterprise infrastructure.</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Enterprise Services Management </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">Enterprise
services management (ESM) provides for managing the service life cycle
and is the foundation for SOA runtime governance. Market research found
a limited number of SOA ESM vendors. The main vendors (e.g., IBM,
Hewlett-Packard) possess strong portfolios in traditional network
management and integrated service management markets that they have
extended to ESM. Most of the tools researched include feature sets
spanning the range from low-level IT service management to the
higher-level business management needs, and the differences are more in
terms of focus. Often, a more comprehensive solution can be composed by
combining products (e.g., AmberPoint and HP OpenView SOA Manager).</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Business Process and Workflow Automation (Business Process Modeling, Execution, and Monitoring)</span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
BTI must provide for the modeling and execution of business processes
through the orchestration of services, and the monitoring of those
business processes. While the research found that there are still many
proprietary modeling offerings, there is considerable convergence
around Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). The research also
found strong support across vendors for the Business Process Execution
Language standard, though there is also emerging support for direct
execution of BPMN through the use of the XML Process Definition
Language, an XML serialization of BPMN. Many vendors also provide the
needed monitoring of those processes at runtime, often building on
extensive experience with network and application monitoring
capabilities. Still further in the future are tools with semantic
continuity from modeling to execution in the business process arena;
however, the research did find that what already exists is maturing
rapidly, and can provide a base for implementing the BTI. Perhaps
surprisingly, not a single vendor included the Unified Modeling
Language in either its list of product offerings relative to an SOA, or
as a tool that it uses in its SOA engagements.</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Data Virtualization and Data Services </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">Among
virtualization trends, virtualizing data sources has emerged as a
real-world capability, and is a key component of the BMA SOA vision in
which a virtual data store makes information from many sources
available in real time without a physical store. The vendors include
Composite Software, Red Hat Meta-matrix, IBM, and Streambase.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
BMA research found that overall data virtualization and associated data
services have matured to the point that there are many cases where they
can produce high-performance and robust data sources and services to be
used in a net-centric environment, significantly reducing the latency
in data availability to business analysts and decision makers who do
not need to wait for the periodic load of a data warehouse or data mart.</p><span class="ctSectionTitle">Information Assurance for SOA</span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">An
SOA introduces new information assurance (IA) challenges. The
interoperability and extended, net-centric data sharing capabilities
enabled by SOAs are themselves potential points of vulnerability. A
compromised service registry provides an attacker with a detailed map
of the operations and capabilities of an organization. Standards and
standard protocols narrow the range of network capabilities that an
attacker must subvert, and success wins wide access. Deploying an SOA
in a responsible fashion must consider the effects of information
warfare in addition to other planning. Only through such IA diligence
will the DoD be able to truly realize the savings and benefits that an
SOA promises for a large, geographically dispersed organization that
must operate in the face of the exigencies of war. Additionally, SOAs
must also meet old IA challenges including reliability, availability,
and non-repudiation. An SOA does not relieve implementers of the
responsibility for solid engineering in areas of platforms, networking,
back-ups, and auditing. Past best practices and standards must be
brought to bear on SOA implementations as well as traditional ones.</p>

would be expected, the DoD is making IA services a part of the
Net-Centric Core Enterprise Services so that security is ubiquitous,
well-tested, and a part of the infrastructure. An SOA provides the
possibility to externalize security as a common, cross-cutting set of
capabilities, themselves presented as services. In this way, each
application or program does not have to master the complex technical
capabilities required, but can declaratively define IA requirements and
expect them to be honored and enforced by the infrastructure. At the
same time, DoD-level IA policy can be enforced on SOA operations,
including authorization control, redaction, and auditing. An SOA must
also work with the DoD&#8217;s Public Key Infrastructure to enable secure
single sign-on, and to ensure preservation of appropriate
non-repudiation characteristics as people and systems take action
against DoD and BMA data assets.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
BTI is intended to embrace and extend the DoD SOA and IA foundations.
During the research, the BMA team studied vendor capabilities with
regard to IA and security in a number of areas. In particular, there
was support for emerging Web Services security standards and the
inclusion of IA capabilities, both for enabling IA and for working with
an enterprise&#8217;s existing IA infrastructure.</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Support for Web Services IA Standards. </strong>Vendor
support for the Web Services standards stack (WS-*) and related sets of
XML and network IA standards&#8212;such as the WS-Security Assertion Markup
Language, and the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language&#8212;is maturing
rapidly along with the standards themselves. These standards are key to
moving IA into the infrastructure, the SOA foundation, and enabling a
declarative IA. Most of the deep stacks of SOA capability, such as
those from IBM, BEA, Oracle, and Microsoft, have incorporated these
standards throughout. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Enabling IA Infrastructure Capabilities. </strong>Some
organizations included in the research (such as AmberPoint) focus
explicitly on providing SOA security capabilities. The market research
found that there is a trend to make IA an integral part of SOA through
provisioning, governance, and key infrastructure, such as with the
BTI&#8217;s interoperability controller. This holds out the promise that as
an SOA is implemented in the BMA, it will not prove to be the <i> soft and chewy inside </i>of a <i> hard and crunchy </i>perimeter defense. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Integration With Existing IA Infrastructure. </strong>DoD
IA must be a consideration from the beginning of the life cycle. An SOA
must be able to work and interoperate with IA standards, practices, and
approaches developed during the DoD and U.S. intelligence community&#8217;s
long experience in producing networked IT systems to provide defense in
depth. The market research found that there is a convergence in this
arena, with the DoD looking to adopt industry and commercial best
practices in IA for its solutions, and SOA vendors (included in the
research) willing to meet and accommodate the stringent IA requirements
of the DoD. </li>
				</ul>
			<p></p><span class="ctSectionTitle">Governance</span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">Governance&#8212;the
means to assure that laws, regulations, and policies are met in IT
operations and investments&#8212;is of key importance for the move to an SOA.
An SOA introduces new challenges for IT and business governance due to
solutions composed from numerous distributed services in an environment
of heterogeneous ownership and control, and by enabling widespread
sharing of information and capabilities. The BMA strategy for SOA
governance addresses both buildtime and runtime needs.</p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Buildtime (Investment) Governance  </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The research assessed buildtime governance in the following areas:</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Enterprise Architecture Satisfaction. </strong>The
research found that enterprise architecture tools are moving to
explicitly model services, such as those from Mega Software or IBM
(Telelogic). However, these tools have (at most) limited
interoperability with tools used to design and develop services. These
tools also provide little in the way of automated compliance checking
or management of the transition between enterprise architecture models
and service designs and implementations. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Duplication Avoidance. </strong>The
research found that this aspect of governance is provided largely by
the ability of SOA development tools and environments to access service
registries and repositories. This allows developers to determine
whether an implementation for their service already exists. Additional
metadata repository capabilities (providing further information)
support this process. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Service Usage. </strong>The
market research found that the main mechanisms for assuring that
existing services are used as appropriate are through development tools
that integrate with an enterprise&#8217;s service registries and
repositories. These tools provide developers with service descriptions
and specifications at design and build time. Many tool vendors, such as
Lombardi and IBM, provide this capability. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Service Verification. </strong>The
market research found that there is good support for test and verify
SOA services&#8212;against functional requirements and service level
agreements (SLAs)&#8212;when combined with more traditional automated testing
tools. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>SLA Development. </strong>The
market research found support for capturing SLAs, but support for the
actual initial development of the SLAs is more limited. System
architects and designers need to pay close attention to how they
develop SLAs and translate them into digital form for use by automated
SLA management capabilities. </li>
				</ul>
			<p></p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Runtime (Operations) Governance </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">Runtime
governance should provide visibility into service operation allowing
management of services, the ability to take corrective action (as
needed) to ensure effectively uninterrupted business operations, and
the capture of operation audit information. Provisioning, deploying new
services, and taking old services out of operation without significant
impact on business activities or overall operations, are key parts of
overall runtime governance. Characteristics looked for in runtime
governance include the following:</p>
<p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Operational Visibility. </strong>Make the runtime state visible in both technical (network and machine usage) and business terms. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Service Management. </strong>Monitor and manage the execution and operation of services in an SOA. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Policy Enforcement. </strong>Enforce
security and other policy-based constraints in a declarative fashion,
external to SOA services, allowing systems to adapt quickly to changing
policy circumstances without coding. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Auditing. </strong>Track and record key events and actions within the SOA environment for later analysis. </li>
					<li>
						<strong>Provisioning and Configuration Management. </strong>Provision services for deployment in the SOA and track its configuration across changes as they occur. </li>
				</ul>
			<p></p><span class="ctSubsectionTitle">Governance Conclusions </span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
market research found no complete solution available as a single
package, but there is considerable governance capability available in
the marketplace. For example, in the area of provisioning and
configuration management, the research found that SOA management tools
provide some of this capability, but may need to be joined with more
traditional configuration management and deployment tools for
reasonable capability. Governance capability (as required by the BMA
strategy for SOA) can be provided through commercial tools, but
designers must carefully assess and acquire the components from various
vendors in accordance with a strong design and plan that they must
create for themselves.</p><span class="ctSectionTitle">Conclusion</span><br><p xmlns:msn="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/msn" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">The
DoD BMA has embarked on an SOA strategy. The &#8220;BMA Architecture
Federation Strategy and Roadmap&#8221; provides guidance for the DoD BMA to
quickly gain business value by delivering capability to support the
warfighter through an SOA, while using a phased approach for
transforming legacy systems. The market research performed by the BMA
Office of the CTO and CA has found that industry capabilities to
implement or enable the components defined in the BMA Service-Oriented
Infrastructure have matured in the marketplace. While serious caution
remains in the areas of IA and security, and the need for significant
cultural change for successful SOA implementation cannot be
overemphasized, it is clear that it is feasible for an enterprise the
size of the DoD to move forward on implementing an SOA and to realize
the business benefits of agility, interoperability, and net-centric
data sharing that an SOA provides.</p>
