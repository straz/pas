<h3>The CIO's Machiavelli -- <br>
An intriguing look at how information technology<br>
has influenced corporate politics</h3>

<p>By Bruce Caldwell
<p><b><a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/info-politics.html">The
Politics Of Information Management</a></b>.<br>
 By Paul Strassmann<br>
 (<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/iep.html">The
Information Economics Press</a>, 800-800-0448, 1994, $49)
<p><hr><p>

Paul Strassmann's most recent book, The Politics Of Information
Management, is a lot like the author's home in New Canaan, Conn. Both
are amply adorned with historical and literary artifacts.<p><p>

``I have always been interested in how the written word influences
power,'' says Strassmann. That interest was evident in two of his
previous books as well, Information Payoff-The Transformation Of Work
In The Electronic Age (1984) and The Business Value Of Computers
(1990). His latest book will be available Oct. 15, and like the
others, is self-published.<p><p>

<h3>More Than Academic</h3>

Strassmann has lectured widely, from the Imperial College in London to
the National Defense University in Washington, but his interest in his
subjects and information technology is more than academic. Strassmann
served as director of defense information at the Defense Department
from 1991 to 1993, where he oversaw a $10 billion annual budget for
information technology and laid the groundwork for a $35 billion
cost-reduction program.<p><p>

But sparring with generals over plans to shrink their empires was
actually less intense, Strassmann says, than the political battles he
participated in at Xerox Corp. and the other companies where he held
high-level information systems positions.<p><p>

Despite that disclaimer, Strassmann's latest book was born of the
realization that the military officers he dealt with at Defense were
more concerned about the organizational consequences of systems
integration than in Strassmann's arguments about why such integration
made sense and was a means to an end.<p><p>

Don't look for gossipy tidbits in the 500-plus pages of The Politics
Of Information Management. The hefty volume, leavened with cartoons,
ironic footnotes, and a satirical glossary, is a serious study of the
evolution of politics in information management.<p><p>

Although it's modeled after Machiavelli's The Prince, the classic
Renaissance guide to power and political intrigue, Strassmann's book
reflects the views of a Jeffersonian democrat, advising readers on how
to apply democratic principles to the management of information to
survive corporate politics.<p><p>

Strassmann's own experiences provide the book's best lessons. For
example, he notes that he went against the tide at Kraft General Foods
Inc. in the 1960s by buying a Honeywell Inc. computer instead of an
IBM machine. That made him an excellent job candidate for an
information technology position at Xerox, which was trying to compete
with IBM in the late 1960s.<p><p>

This won't be the last word from Strassmann. A fourth book, The
Alignment Of Information Management With Business Planning, will be
published next year. Offering detailed economic analysis of 200 major
corporations and their use of information technology, the book will
focus on the quantitative underpinnings of Strassmann's management
theories.<p><p>

<h3>More In The Pipeline</h3>

In addition, a slim paperback volume of the epigrams, cartoons, and
glossary from The Politics Of Information Management will come out in
February. Next September, Strassmann will publish a book on
information warfare, just as he begins teaching a new round of classes
at the National Defense University. Addressing the needs of the
post-Cold War military, the book will explain how to render your
enemies ``deaf, blind, and stupid.'' No doubt it will be recommended
reading for those who didn't heed the tips in Strassmann's earlier
books.<p><p>
