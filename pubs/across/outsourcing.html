<hr>
<font size="+2">P</font>erhaps the most crucial contemporary issue of
information management is whether to outsource all or some of the
information technologies to specialized-services firms. The issue is
not a transient phenomenon; the shift from company-management
computing to outsourcing is accelerating. The decision when, how, and
where to outsource is likely to be one of the few
information-management issues that will be coming up for review at
board meetings.<p>

So far, there is only one good explanation that fits almost every case
of outsourcing information technologies: The outsourcing corporations
are trying to return to profitability by cutting employment.<p>

That is not, however, the rationale one finds in press releases
announcing the transfer of most information-processing assets to an
outsourcer. One hears assertions about computers no longer being a
core competency.  "Partnership for innovation" is another oft-quoted
phrase. The plain fact is that top executives have become disenchanted
with their capacity to digest information technologies. Massive
divestment of a corporation's IT resources appears to be more
like an emetic than a miracle cure.<p>

<h3>The Puzzle</h3>

I didn't start out thinking this way. What I read in trade magazines
about letting professional firms manage the modernization of information
technologies was entirely plausible. Nevertheless, I was apprehensive
about the benefits of outsourcing. I also knew a great deal about
two huge outsourcing contracts that crippled their firms' information
management for years and made them unable to respond to competitive
encroachments.<p>

It seems that whenever corporate management discovers it must write
off a large portion of existing systems assets and enter into another
round of modernization, the first reaction is to replace their
computer chiefs. To avoid any confrontations with accumulations of
neglectful practices, the new CIO then launches a program of
modernization calling for brand-new applications. Old programs thus
become useless junk and the software branded euphemistically as
"legacy software."<p>

The act of writing off the accumulated knowledge of prior years,
whether in people or software, opens the door to outsourcing
contractors. Unencumbered by maintenance or operating problems,
there's a hope that these experienced mercenaries are more likely
to get the job accomplished. Meanwhile, the talent that previously
guarded the information assets of the organization gets the unglamorous
custodial task of keeping daily operations going while waiting for
the newcomers to collect all the prizes. No wonder this creates
conditions ripe for a disaster.<p>

When computer people recommend modernization, they usually concentrate
on the desirability of replacing equipment and software. What they
miss are the problems of organization, motivation, and conflict that
take place when previously essential talent learn that they are about
to become a disposable rear guard.<p>

Announcements of the dismissal or transfer of computer personnel
featured imaginative stories telling why a function with the
reputation of being one of the corporation's critical success factors
should now be transferred into the hands of complete outsiders. Some
corporations claimed that their information technologies were not an
essential part of their business anymore but, rather, like electric
power or the water supply. For others, the divestment of routine
processing was expected to make it possible to concentrate on
strategic systems. One also heard that outsourcing was preferable
because the contractors offered technical expertise that the firm
could not muster by other means.<p>

It's impossible to list all the reasons for outsourcing. It has become
the computer business' fastest-expanding segment. In 1995, worldwide
outsourcing revenue was $76 billion, with the United States making up
48 percent of that total. Most of the outsourcing (64 percent) was for
processing standard transactions such as claims, billing, and credit
cards. Only 33 percent was for IT services. Maintenance and support of
centralized computing facilities accounted for about half of these
services. Only a small fraction of that (less than 10 percent) was for
systems planning, integration, and implementation.<p>

Should top management view massive outsourcing of IT as a new and
imaginative way to obtain such services, or as an excuse for getting
rid of responsibilities that they have been unable to manage all
along?<p>

<h3>The Search</h3>

One would expect outsourcing to be a widely spread occurrence
throughout the Fortune 1,000 if it does indeed improve strategic fit,
realizes lower costs, takes advantage of vendor's skills, and
overcomes the dearth of technical expertise. Outsourcing should be an
equally good solution for anyone. It would work well for all
corporations, without regard to size, industry, assets, profitability,
or growth, as each finds that one or more of the many claimed
benefits satisfy their needs.<p>

Applying such reasoning, outsourcing would show up as a random
phenomenon, modestly biased in favor of growth corporations
seeking added resources to enhance their capabilities. Statistical
analysis would then reveal whether outsourcing is a random, evenly
spread phenomenon or clustered around some causal connection.<p>

To examine the randomness hypothesis, I asked a librarian to assemble
a list of commercial companies that most frequently appeared in the
trade press as corporations that have taken outsourcing actions.  With
this list I searched my productivity database, which includes data
about operating performance of U.S. corporations, as well as their IT
budgets. With that, I set out to determine if there were any
discernible characteristics among corporations that chose to outsource
more than half of their IT resources.<p>

I ran many statistical tests, which revealed that the occurrence of
outsourcing was not random. The analysis showed a connection between
outsourcing and a firm's economic value-added.<p>

Those corporations that outsourced more than 60% of their IT budget
were economic losers when they began outsourcing. They were probably
shedding IT resources along with other corporate functions because
they were in financial trouble. I could not find any corporation
with a consistently large economic value-added and rising employment
that outsourced most of its information technologies, despite claims
of synergy or the advantages of getting rid of commodity work.
The losers were casting off IT because they were shrinking their
firms anyway.<p>

<h3>Anorexia</h3>

Outsourcing is, in reality, only one aspect of a currently popular
downsizing trend among troubled corporations. It takes place under a more
palatable label, just as reengineering is, in most cases, a euphemism
for cutbacks.<p>

The IT community has consistently ranked, in a wide range of surveys,
as one of the least admired corporate functions and therefore becomes
an attractive target when there is a new quota regarding how many
bodies must leave.<p>

Cutting staff, divesting business, and getting rid of hundreds of
person-years of accumulated skill seems to be a prevailing compulsion
among large firms that are seeking to improve profitability by
shrinking their size. Although the number of papers that deal with
outsourcing is considerable, only a 1993 work by MIT researchers Erik
Brynjolfsson and Loren Hitt has studied the relationship between
outsourcing and profitability.<p>

They noted that, "[C]ompanies that try to jump on the outsourcing
bandwagon may be chasing a parked car. We found no association between
outsourcing and success. If anything, companies that outsourced more
of their information systems work tend to have lower productivity and
profitability. The only performance measure heavy outsourcers did
well on was stock-market returns. In the short term, the market 
reacts favorably to outsourcing. Whether the market will continue
to react favorably, especially if productivity doesn't improve,
remains to be seen."<p>

One could say that outsourcing has many of the attributes of anorexia
nervosa.  People with anorexia have a distorted self-image that makes
them feel fat even when emaciated; preoccupation with food, low
self-esteem, and emphatic denial of the problem characterize most
anorexics. Similarly, executives in companies with poor financial 
performance seem to concentrate on downsizing as the preferred
method for restoring competitiveness.<p>

Unfortunately, shareholders and investors don't have a clue about
the losses to the firm whenever knowledgeable workers leave in
droves. There is no such thing as a balance-sheet write-off for
human capital. When machinery or buildings become scrap, the auditors
reflect that cost with a great deal of precision. The government 
even allows taking decisions to scrap as a tax deduction. Because
outsourcing always takes computers off the list of financial assets,
the accountants see that reduction in costs while neglecting
the loss of the employees' know-how and commitment to serve
the enterprise.<p>

There's always a test to see if a corporation did or did not abandon
its essential information capabilities, and it's a simple one: Does
the firm retain the choice to repatriate, or move its systems to
another vendor without excessive expense, no matter what has been
outsourced? If that exit option from outsourcing has an executable
plan, then the essential managerial competence of the firm remains
intact.<p>

I am in favor of outsourcing for any of the good reasons that would
take advantage of somebody else's capacity to accumulate knowledge
faster than when it remains homegrown. It should not be a substitute
for the corporate version of an emetic. I shall find encouragement
about the prospects for outsourcing when I see a large list of
prosperous and growing organizations that use this option to enhance
their mastery of information management.<p>

<h2> The Brains of the Company </h2>

<font size="+2">T</font>he medical profession has learned how to do
heart transplants, simulate the functions of kidneys, and implant
synthetic knee, hip, elbow, and wrist joints. So far, it is
inconceivable to do a brain transplant. The brain is
individual-specific, whereas other parts of a body have only generic
characteristics. The brain stores a person's knowledge patterns and
experiences, which make individuals what they are, whereas body parts
are equivalent to interchangeable mechanical components.<p>

The brain is also where a person retains a sense of individuality and
privacy. Therefore, one of the critical issues in outsourcing is the
safeguarding of uniquely confidential information. The outsourcing
contract between Swiss Bank Corp. and Perot Systems solved this
problem admirably.  The bank retained all of the input and output
processing within the bank, while Perot Systems handled only encrypted
data, without ever having access to the encryption keys. Swiss Bank
gave up nothing of importance, because it had reserved to itself all
options and privileges. It had not yielded any of its essential
managerial functions.<p>

My studies show that more than 85 percent of corporations now spend
more on information management than on financial capital. Therefore, I
consider it unwise for management to let someone else manage all of
their information systems processes. Information management and
information systems (whether computerized or not) are indeed the core
competence of almost every business in the information age. With the
increasing embodiment of information management into software, the
control over information systems remains one of the essential
managerial functions that an organization should not fully
abdicate.<p>

<h2>Outsourcing? Try Out-Tasking</h2>

<font size="+2">T</font>here are good and sufficient reasons for selectively
outsourcing. I call that <i>out-tasking</i>, and it applies if any of the
following conditions prevail:

<ul>
<li>The organization is incapable of attracting or retaining talent
for specialized technologies, especially for innovative uses. It is 
increasingly true in the public sector.<p>

<li>The budgeting and capital-investment process is spasmodic,
short-term-oriented, and subject to reversals in top management's
goals, objectives, and preferences. Increasingly, this characterizes
much of the industry, as well as most of the public sector.<p>

<li>The learning curve for a new or risky technology is 
especially steep. Therefore, it pays to have an experienced
firm introduce the technology at a much lower cost.
If the new service becomes attractive, one can always reconsider
the outsourcing decision. I have used this strategy over the
years with considerable success by negotiating a favorable 
licensing and technology-transfer agreement as a clause in 
the initial agreement.<p>

<li>The organization is internally in turmoil and cannot
manage IT because its managerial energies are concentrating
on the survival of the firm.<p>

<li>The organization is very profitable but does not wish to 
devote scarce managerial resources to managing IT.
This calls for inventing new forms of relationships
that may not be arm's-length commercial contracts.

</ul>
