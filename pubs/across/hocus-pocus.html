<h2>The Hocus-Pocus of Reengineering</h2>
<b>by Paul A. Strassmann<br><br>
Across The Board</b><br>
June 1994<hr>

Make no mistake: Reengineering is a great idea as well as a clever buzz
word. What manager wouldn't support the notion of taking something that is
defective and fixing it? Industrial engineers, methods analysts, and
efficiency experts have done it for years.<p>

Naturally, reengineering is too good to be new. A contemporary repackaging
of tried-and-true industrial engineering methods, this cure now is being
administered in large doses to business enterprises that to survive must
instantly show improved profits.<p>

In one important way, though, reengineering differs from past incremental
and analytic methods and allies itself with more suspect movements: In
political terms, it more closely resembles a coup d'etat than a
parliamentary democracy.<p>

Those applying the label "efficiency through reengineering" advocate the
adoption of radical means to achieve corrective actions. This extremism
offers seemingly instant relief from the pressure on corporate executives
to show immediate improvements. It calls for discarding all existing
institutions and reconstituting an organization on the basis of completely
fresh ideas; the new business model is expected to spring forth from the
inspired insights of a new leadership team.<p>

The reengineering movement's tone is set by its most prominent proponent,
Michael Hammer, co-author of Reengineering the Corporation (Harper
Business). He consistently invokes violence and revolution in rhetoric and
practice. "The way you deal with resistance [to reengineering] is . . . a
bloody ax," he told Across the Board a year ago. "Al Capone once said, 'You
get a lot further with a gun and a kind word than with a kind word alone."
Matching new prophets' ideas with past patterns helps determine whether
their proposals simply repackage what has been tried before. Hammer's
dogmatic pronouncements- as well as his sentence structure- resonate with
the radical views put forth by political hijackers like Robespierre, Lenin,
Mao, and Guevara. By replacing some of Hammer's nouns, one can produce
slogans attributed to those who gained power by overthrowing the existing
order. The following is a small collection of direct quotations from
pronouncements by Michael Hammer. They are offered to illuminate the
intellectual roots of reengineering thought from someone who claims to be
its initiator:<p>
<pre>
"American managers . . . must abandon the organizational and operational
principles and procedures they are now using and create entirely new
ones.... Business reengineering means starting all over, starting from
scratch.... It means forgetting how work was done.... Old job titles and
old organizational arrangements . . . cease to matter. How people and
companies did things yesterday doesn't matter to the business reengineer
.... Reengineering ... can't be carried out in small and cautious steps. 
It is an all-or-nothing proposition."
   Reengineering the Corporation

"In this journey we'll carry our wounded and shoot the dissenters.... I
want to purge from the business vocabulary: CEO, manager, worker, job."
   Forbes ASAP, Sept. 13, 1993

"It's basically taking an axe and a machine gun to your existing organization."
   Computerworld,Jan. 24,  1994

"What you do with the existing structure is nuke it!"
   Site Selection, February 1993

"Reengineering must be initiated . . . by someone who has . . . enough
status to break legs."
   Planning Review, May/June 1993

"You either get on the train or we'll run over you with the train.... The
last thing in the world that reengineering does is enhance the manager's
sense of self-importance, because one of the things that reengineering says
is that managing isn't so important."
   Across the Board, June 1993

"Reengineering . . . will require a personality transplant . . . a lobotomy."
   Computerworld, June 1, 1987

"Don't try to forestall reengineering. If senior management is serious
about reengineering they'll shoot you."
   Management Review, September 1993
</pre>

It is an unlikely coincidence that the most widely read book on
reengineering carries the provocative subtitle A Manifesto for Business
Revolution and claims to be a "seminal" book comparable to Adam Smith's An
Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations - the
intellectual underpinning of capitalism. Keep in mind that another popular
polemic, also bearing the title "Manifesto," successfully spread the
premise that the only way to improve capitalism is to obliterate it.<p>

<h3>Competing Moralities</h3>

Much more is at issue here than reengineering itself; the question is one
of the morality of commerce against the morality of warfare.<p>

The morality of warfare-of vengeance, violent destruction, and the use of
might-has been with us ever since primitive tribes competed for hunting
grounds. Societies have recognized the importance of warfare by sanctioning
a class, subject to some rules, to kill, while the redeeming code of
loyalty and self-sacrifice for the good of all would prevail.<p>

The morality of commerce, with us since 500 B.C. or so., is based on
shunning force, developing voluntary agreements, collaborating even with
strangers and aliens, respecting contracts, and promoting exchanges that
benefit both the buyers and the sellers.<p>

Nearly every large-scale tragedy of the last few centuries can be traced to
the substitution of the morality of warfare for the morality of commerce,
under the guise that this will lead to greater overall prosperity. Hammer's
adoption of the non-redeeming expressions of military morality crosses the
line of acceptability. Reengineering, an activity in the commercial domain,
should be bound by its morality, with military language and thinking left
to those who must confront the prospect of getting shot at.<p>

Reengineering's radical promoters have succeeded in gaining at least
temporary respectability, successfully translating 1960s radicalism-with
its socially unacceptable slogan, "Do not reform, obliterate!"-into a
fashionable, money-making proposition. Their clarion call for overthrowing
the status quo is similar to that trumpeted by the students who occupied
deans' offices across the United States. Now those arguments are parlayed
into lucrative consulting assignments.<p>

Leaders of revolutionary political movements since the French Revolution
have been fixed on seizing power under whatever slogan could be sold to
those hoping to improve justice, freedom, or profit. And those same
leaders-mostly intellectuals who rarely delivered more than pamphlets and
speeches-have consistently worsened conditions after taking over the
Establishment.<p>

Reengineering fits neatly into patterns of past revolutionary movements: In
each case, the leaders call for uncompromising destruction of existing
institutions. Only through this kind of attack on customs, habits, and
relationships can newcomers gain influence with little opposition. The
common characteristic of the elite that agitates destructively for
positions of leadership is an arrogance that they are the only ones with
superior insight, the only ones deserving of trust.<p>

<h3>The Solution: Business Process Improvement</h3>

To be effective, any way to improve the way people work must be
evolutionary, not revolutionary. The long history of miscarriages of
centrally planned radical reforms, in addition to reengineering's
as-yet-dismal track record (as acknowledged by Hammer himself in an
interview last summer), suggest that evolutionary approaches deliver better
and more permanent improvements. Evolutionary change stimulates morale and
imagination, creating conditions for rewarding organizational learning and
for inspiring employees to discover innovative ways to deal with adversity
and competitive challenges.<p>

I call this more moderate approach "business-process improvement" (BPI).
The first step-one that reengineering proponents generally skip-is gaining
widespread support for change; after all, lasting improvements in business
processes can be made only with the support of those who know the business.
Leadership's primary task is creating conditions for continuous,
incremental, and adaptive change.<p>

Too often companies signal impending change poorly: by downsizing. Abrupt
cutbacks responding to a steadily deteriorating financial situation are a
sure sign that management has been incompetent or asleep. Dismissing
employees on a large scale, accompanied by incentives for longtime
employees to resign voluntarily, paralyzes the survivors with fear and an
aversion to taking initiative. It forces out those most qualified to find
employment elsewhere.<p>

Getting rid of people whose skills have become obsolete reflects the
organization's failure to innovate and learn. Liquidating a company is easy
and profitable, but rebuilding it for growth pays off in the long term.
While reengineering requires the company to take outside consultants'
advice, BPI depends primarily on mobilizing employee commitment and
imaginative cooperation, relying heavily on in-house know-how to find
conditions that will support the creation of new jobs - even if that means
that many existing positions will disappear.<p>

BPI calls for applying rigorous methods to charting, pricing, and
process-flow analysis of "as is" conditions. Process improvement continues
for the lifetime of a company, with each major improvement bringing forth
new payoff opportunities. The objective is to create a learning environment
in which renewal and gain will be an ongoing process instead of just a
one-time shock therapy. Adopting formal process-flow methods and a
consistent technique for tracking local improvements allows the company to
later combine processes initially isolated for short-term, local
productivity gains.<p>

In BPI, the people directly affected by the potential changes study the "as
is" conditions and propose "to be" alternatives to achieve the desired
improvements. In BPI everybody with an understanding of the business will
be asked to participate.<p>

For example, a government agency incurs internal charges of $10.05 per
employee paycheck issued due to layers upon layers of bureaucracy. By
comparison, a local commercial-services company - with integrated,
streamlined processes - incurs charges of only $1.67. To bring down that
$10.05 figure, employees are helping to compile "as is" work-flow diagrams
showing who does what and when and how. Upon entering the diagrams into a
computer, they will know that the paycheck costs so much because it has to
go through, typically, the controller, then the personnel department, then
the regional processing center, then the auditors.<p>

The next step will be to complete a "to be" diagram showing how much money
and time is saved when one link-say, the controller-is removed. Then the
organization can determine how to skip that element, finding that the
controller can pre approve checks and doesn't need to see them. After that
it's a simple (though grueling) matter of examining each process in turn.
BPI balances the involvement of information managers, operating managers,
and subject-matter experts. Cooperative teams are assembled under non
threatening circumstances in which much time is spent, even wasted, in
discussing and evaluating different viewpoints. Unanimity is not what
business process is all about: Differences are recorded, debated, and
passed on to higher levels of management for resolution.<p>

BPI requires that you perform a business-case analysis, which not only
calculates payoffs but also reveals the risks of each proposed alternative.
This is not popular because current computerized methods of analysis have
too little integrity to be acceptable to financial executives.<p>

<h3>Reengineering: The Autocrat's Salvation</h3>

Business-process improvement's advantage over reengineering lies in its
approach to managing organizational change. A relatively slow and
deliberate process-improvement effort is more in tune with the approach
that people normally use to cope with major changes.<p>

Every day should be Process Improvement Day - that is how organizational
learning takes place and how you gain employee commitment. At each
incremental stage of process improvement, your people can keep pace with
their leaders, developing the same understanding of the business. They are
allowed the opportunity to think about what they are doing. They are not
intimidated by precipitous layoffs that inhibit their sharing of ideas on
how to use their own time and talent more effectively.<p>

As currently practiced, reengineering assumes that your own people cannot
be trusted to fix whatever ails your organization. It requires you to
accept what the experts, preferably newcomers to the scene, tell you.
In reengineering the consultants recommend what the "to be" conditions
ought to look like, without learning the reasons for the "as is"
conditions. Reengineering's credo is to forget everything you know about
your business and start with a clean slate to "reinvent" what you would
like to be.<p>

But what applies to individuals or nations certainly applies to
corporations: It is never wise to disregard your people, relationships with
customers, assets, accumulated knowledge, or reputation. Versions of the
phrase ". . . throw history into the dustbin and start anew" have been
attributed to every failed radical movement of the last 200 years.<p>

Reengineering proponents worry little about formal methods. They practice
emergency surgery, typically amputation and tourniquet-like remedies to
stop the flow of red ink. Reengineering may be appropriate under emergency
conditions of imminent danger-but only as long as management understands
that work-force demoralization means the patient may never fully recover.
Hammer's simple methods, much swifter than BPI's more deliberate approach,
are preferred by the impatient and those not compelled to cope with the
long-term consequences of what happens to the quality and the dedication of
the work force.<p>

In reengineering, participation by  most of the existing management is
superfluous, because what is in place will be junked anyway. Under such
conditions, for instance, bringing in a successful cookie-company manager
to run a computer company makes perfect sense. In reengineering, debate is
discouraged since the goal is to produce a stroke of insight that will turn
everything around in a flash.<p>

Autocratic managers leap at the opportunity to preside over a reengineering
effort, as do chief information officers (CIOs) with propensities to offer
technological means as a way of introducing revolutionary changes. In
recent national meetings, computer executives have offered reengineering as
the antidote to the declining position of the CIOs, which according to some
stands for "Career Is Over."<p>

Reengineering conveys a sense of urgency that does not dwell on much
financial analysis, and certainly not on formal risk assessment; managers
who tend to rely on bold strokes rebel against analytic disciplines.<p>

Business-case analysis brings forth the traditional confrontation of the
tortoise and the hare - the plodders versus the hipshooters. Though the
hipshooters sometimes win, the odds are against them in an endurance
contest.

<h3>Slow and Steady Wins the Race</h3>

Reengineering offers neither the time nor the opportunities for an
organization to adapt smoothly to changing conditions. It imposes changes
swiftly, by fiat, usually from a collection of people imported to make long
overdue changes. Even if the new approach is a superior one for jarring an
organization out of its ingrown bad habits, it is difficult to implement
because those supposed to act differently now are reluctant to do their
creative best in support of the transition from the old to the new.<p>

Reengineering has the advantage of being a choice of last resort when no
time is left to implement business-process improvement. In this sense, it
is akin to saying that dictatorship sometimes is more effective than
community participation. The drastic cure may have lingering, even fatal,
side effects.<p>

Despite occasional reversals in fortune, constitutional democracies have
never willingly accepted dictatorship as the way out of their troubles, and
the record of drastic, last ditch attempts to deal with crises in
governance is dismal. Despite occasional short-term improvements, extreme
solutions often destroy past accumulation of human capital, and
retrospectively, these eras of violence are always viewed as times of
retrogression.<p>
