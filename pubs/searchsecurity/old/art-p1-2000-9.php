The famous bank robber Willie Sutton was reputed to reply to the judge, when 

asked why he robbed banks, "because that's where the money is."</P>



<p>Nowadays, when information is stolen, compromised, corrupted or
destroyed, that is not done with a six-shooter. Willie always knew how
to count his loot, but how do you put a price on corporate information
that you must protect? From the standpoint of an information security
executive, the challenge of answering the question about the worth of
protecting a firm's wealth embodied in information is always a
difficult one.<p>

Corporate CFOs, proud about their balance sheet accounts that detail a
firm's petty cash, inventory, fixed assets and buildings to the
nearest penny, will always delight in torturing a petitioner from the
IT department who asks for money for something as vague as
"information security."</p>



<h3>Justifying information security spending</h3> 

<p>As corporate wealth based on information becomes more encompassing
and pervasive, the issue of valuation of information risks cannot be
dealt with intimidating paranoia. Based on my 30 years as a CIO of
large but stingy global corporations, I have learned how to get more
money for IT in ways that are not only credible but defensible as
well. This involves applying the principle: "If you wish to justify
it, you must be able to value it." The question is, how do you justify
spending on information security in ways that are both practical as
well as verifiable? How do you make a presentation in which you will
be asking for added security funds? What do you show that does not
make you look like a flaky techno-promoter peddling exorbitant
expenditures with nothing but threat and terrorism scenarios (with
ample help from consultants ready to assist you) to support your
otherwise fact-free slides?</p>



<h3>Step #1: Threats to tangible assets</h3>

<p>As the first step, you must concentrate on matters that are so
obvious that everyone will instantly understand what you are talking
about. Start with a discussion of threats to tangible information
assets, which I define as anything that touches the shareholder
financial reports as defined by "generally accepted accounting
practices -- GAAP." Do you have information assets on the books that
can suddenly lose their book value? This would include all matters of
physical security, such as loss of computers (from whatever source),
disappearance of laptops (a frequent occurrence), write-offs of
software investments (that multimillion dollar "enterprise system"
that will be replaced by "e-commerce" before it is fully depreciated)
or the expensive customer database that you acquired during the latest
merger and now is useless.<p>

Personally, I do not believe that most corporations will have much of
security or risk exposures from the loss of tangible information
assets. However, it is paramount that before you launch on dealing
with the security risks involving "intangible assets" that your
audience perceives you as a trustworthy and thoughtful fiduciary
custodian. You must be seen in the same colorless hue as the firm's
accountants or auditors, regardless of how unpalatable such mimicry
may be to your tastes. If you succeed passing this test, you are ready
to proceed with the real issues.</p>


<h3>Step #2: Start talking about risks in dollar terms</h3> 

<p>Next, you must display a thorough understanding of the worth of
your firm's knowledge (or intellectual) assets in dollar denominated
terms. Here is where you could fall into the trap of trying to talk
your way by reverting to the latest buzzwords that are associated with
these concepts. Almost everything that has been written on this topic
is of little value because it comes from sociologists or professors
who have never run a corporate computer department. The most legible
stuff originates with journalists who are very good in quoting what
the sociologists and professors say.<p>

Just do a web search on "Intellectual Capital" and you will be
overwhelmed by thousands of pages of erudite text that does not relate
in any way to money except for making vague allusions to the stock
market valuations that somehow prove the intellectual worth of your
firm. If you follow such advice (and the much cited Skandia Insurance
Company is always used as an example) beware that under no
circumstances should you succumb to the temptation to relate your
information security funding requests to specific threats to your
firm's share prices. The ever-present legal counsel will march you out
of the conference room and you will be never invited to make a budget
presentation again.</p>
