<h2>Collaborative commerce to "dramatically alter industrial economics"</h2>

There is a $2 trillion pool of profits to be had if every organisation
participates in collaborative commerce. That was one of a string of
headline grabbing messages delivered by Paul Strassmann, the renowned
IT economist, business author, and visionary, at the Information Age
Collaborative Commerce Conference in London this week.<p>

Strassmann, a former information technology chief at Xerox and the US
Department of Defense, whose special interest is the return on
investment of technology, focused on transaction costs - usually a
major component of the sales, general and administrative costs (SG &A)
on the profit and loss account - as an area where huge savings will
ultimately be made. These savings, however, will take years to realise
and will be built up incrementally and aggregated through the supply
chain.<p>

Strassmann pointed out that transaction costs, regardless of IT
investment, now account for 34% of a typical manufacturing company's
purchasing costs - a figure that has steadily risen over the past two
decades. Collaborative commerce can slice that figure down to 24%, he
said.<p>

But technology, despite suppliers' claims that it can streamline the
supply chain, fine-tune inventory and bring about a revolution in the
way manufacturing and distribution is approached, is not, in itself,
the answer, he stressed. "Losers always ask for more IT but there's no
relation between money spent on technology and profits. IT executives
need to look at transaction costs, data centre efficiencies, and
product, service and marketing cost at the very least. They need to be
strategists," he says.<p>

IT plays a crucial role in a collaborative infrastructure, he
conceded. But it has to be capable of accelerating the real-time
processing required to compete in the new business environment. That
means junking many existing investments. "Dismantle batch processing
in data centres," Strassmann told conference delegates, a move that
"could mean $4 trillion in software write-offs." He advised IT
directors to prepare their boards to accept these write-offs are
necessary.<p>

Strassmann, drawing on historical experience, said the impact of the
information revolution would be made gradually, over the course of a
century, and in the process there would be political and industrial
upheaval. The elimination of large bodies of entrenched interests,
such as lawyers, tax collectors and purchasing departments, can reduce
transaction costs, he said, but he warned that these groups have an
economic interest preventing the commodisation of economic
transactions.<p>
