<p> <img src="http://graphics.nytimes.com/images/i.gif" align=left alt=I>n a nation of technophiles, where Internet millionaires are
minted daily, it seems heresy to question the economic payoff from
information technology -- the billions upon billions spent each year
by companies and households on everything from computers to
software to cell phones.

<p> But for more than a decade, most of the nation's leading
economists have been heretics. They have not been much impressed by
the high-tech dogma -- embraced by corporate executives, business
school professors and Wall Street alike -- that regards the
transformation of the economy through the magic of information
technology as a self-evident truth.

<p> "You can see the Computer Age everywhere," Robert Solow, a
Nobel prizewinner from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
wrote a few years ago, "but in the productivity statistics."

<p> For years, even as the computer revolutionized the workplace,
productivity -- the output of goods and services per worker --
stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a year. So it is easy to see
how Solow's pithy comment became the favorite punchline of the
economic naysayers.

<p> Yet today, even renowned skeptics on the subject of technology's
contribution to the economy, like Solow, are having second
thoughts. Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996,
capped by a surge in the second half of last year, after eight
years of economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past
upward swings in productivity typically occurred early in a
recovery as economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased
hiring, it slowed again.

 But something seems fundamentally different this time, something
apparently having a lot to do with the increased speed and
efficiency that the Internet and other pervasive
information-technology advances are bringing to the mundane
day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses.

<p> The question, posed by economists, is whether the higher
productivity growth, averaging about 2 percent in the last three
years, roughly double the pace from 1973 to 1995, is the
long-awaited confirmation that the nation's steadily rising
investment in computers and communications is finally paying off.
The evidence is starting to point in that direction.

<p> "My beliefs are shifting on this subject," said Solow. "I am
still far from certain. But the story always was that it took a
long time for people to use information technology and truly become
more efficient. That story sounds a lot more convincing today than
it did a year or two ago."

<p> Another pillar in the pessimist camp was Daniel Sichel, an
economist at the Federal Reserve. His work, along with another Fed
economist, Stephen Oliner, in 1994, and on his own in 1997, found
that computers contributed little to productivity growth. But
recently, Sichel ran similar calculations for the last few years
and came to a different conclusion.

<p> In a paper that has just been published in the quarterly
"Business Economics," Sichel wrote that his new work points to
"a striking step up in the contribution of computers to output
growth." And the nation's improved productivity performance, he
noted, is "raising the possibility that businesses are finally
reaping the benefits of information technology."

<p> The impact of information technology on the economy is more than
an academic debate. If, as some experts assert, the technology
dividend is a key reason for the nation's extraordinary run of high
growth, rising wages and low inflation, there are significant
policy implications. If the recent gains are not just a temporary
blip, it suggests that the Federal Reserve can be less fearful of
inflation and keep interest rates stable rather than be forced to
raise them to cool off what would otherwise be considered an
overheated economy.

<p> Indeed, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the other Fed
governors are scheduled to hear presentations on information
technology's effect on the economy from several academics during a
private meeting in Washington on Thursday.

<p> Greenspan, for one, seems to believe a fundamental change is
under way. He told Congress early this year that the economy was
enjoying "higher, technology-driven productivity growth."

<p> The Fed governors will hear a forceful case for technological
optimism from Erik Brynjolfsson, an associate professor at the MIT
Sloan School of Management.

<p> Brynjolfsson asserts that the economic value of speed, quality
improvements, customer service and new products are often not
captured by government statistics. "These are the competitive
advantages of information technology," he said. "We need a
broader definition of output in this new economy, which goes beyond
the industrial-era concept of widgets coming off the assembly
line."

<p> The government, after years of defending its figures, conceded
two weeks ago that productivity growth may be understated. The core
of the problem, government economists say, is the increasingly
complex challenge of defining and measuring output in much of the
economy's fast-growing service sector, which includes the vast
reaches of banking, finance, health care and education.

<p> According to the official statistics, a bank today is only about
80 percent as productive as a bank in 1977. Yet that seems to take
scant account of, say, 24-hour automated teller machines, which
clearly benefit customers who no longer have to wait in lines to be
served by human tellers during regular "bankers' hours."

<p> Edwin Dean, chief of the productivity division of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, wrote in a new research paper that the agency was
increasingly concerned that its measurements did not "fully
reflect changes in the quality of goods and services" or "capture
the full impact of new technology on economic performance."

<p> Still, the government's methods of measurement will not be
overhauled anytime soon. "These are tough, tough questions and we
are not going to get instant solutions," Dean explained in an
interview.

<p> American corporations long ago made up their minds, voting for
technology with their dollars. Investment in information technology
-- computing and telecommunications gear -- has quadrupled over the
last decade, rising as a share of all business spending on
equipment from 29 percent to 53 percent, according to the Commerce
Department. And that is only the hardware. There have been similar
surges in corporate spending on software, consulting, technical
support and training related to the field.

<p> "The payoff from information technology is unquestionably there
with individual companies and we're seeing it over and over
again," said Chuck Rieger, a senior consultant at IBM's services
division.

<p>

<p>

<p> Of course, anecdotal evidence from individual companies is no
proof of broad-based benefits in an $8.5-trillion economy. But what
many experts find encouraging is that the rapid introduction of
low-cost Internet technology means most companies can now afford to
set up electronic links with customers and suppliers. For example,
a recent survey of 2,500 manufacturing companies, conducted by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, found that the number of factories with
Internet links to customers and suppliers doubled last year.

<p> At more and more companies, these Internet-based networks are
already streamlining the mundane chores of business life like
invoicing, purchasing and inventory control. This is not the
glamorous side of Internet commerce, occupied by Amazon.com and
others selling consumer products. Yet if a technology dividend in
productivity is at hand, the place to look is in the back offices
of business. "That is where it will be," Solow, the MIT
economists, said, "in the wholesale automation of corporate
transactions."

<p> This business-to-business commerce over the Internet is
projected to jump from $48 billion in 1998 to $1.5 trillion by
2003, according to Forrester Research Inc. During the same period,
the research firm estimates that consumer sales over Internet will
rise from $3.9 billion to $108 billion.

<p> The service sector of the economy is where productivity gains
appear to have been especially sluggish and where experts are
looking most closely for evidence of an efficiency payoff from
technology.

<p> In Chicago, Michael Rushmore, a banker, speaks of how Internet
computing has "fundamentally changed the way we do business" over
the last three or four years. Take the way corporate loans are
syndicated among many banks, notes Rushmore, a managing director of
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, the securities arm of
BankAmerica Corp.

<p> Until about two years ago, syndicating a large corporate bank
loan meant distributing a lengthy offering document, often running
more than 200 pages, to 50 to 100 banks. It was, Rushmore recalled,
a nightmarish, inefficient process that involved waves of overnight
mail, constant faxing and armies of messengers.

<p> Today, much of that process is handled over the Internet on bank
Web sites that other banks tap into to read and download the
offering document, ask questions and exchange views. Rushmore
estimates that the Internet-based system trims 25 percent from the
time it takes to close a deal, not just improving the ease of the
transaction but also saving an immense amount of hours of work.

<p> About a year ago Booz Allen & Hamilton began using the Internet
to bill several federal agencies that are its clients. Booz Allen
estimates that it has saved $150,000 a year by eliminating the
paper handling on its $10 million in monthly billings to the
government. The greater speed and efficiency of the electronic
billing also means that the consulting firm is being paid 30
percent, or six days, faster than before.

<p> "Getting that money into the bank much more quickly is probably
the biggest benefit," said Mark Arnsberger, an assistant
controller for Booz Allen & Hamilton.

<p> The rapid spread of Internet-based computing, experts say,
promises to compress the time it takes for any new technology to
enhance economic welfare in general. The classic study of the
phenomenon, "The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical
Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox," by Paul David, an
economic historian at Stanford University, was published in 1990.

<p> The electric motor, David noted, was introduced in the early
1880s but did not generate discernible productivity gains until the
1920s. It took that long, he wrote, not only for the technology to
be widely distributed but also for businesses to reorganize work
around the industrial productionline, the efficiency breakthrough
of its day.

<p> "The process takes longer than people think, but I still
believe that we will get a revival of productivity growth led by
the spread of computing," David said.

<p> His is a misplaced faith, according to the dwindling band of
techno-pessimists whose own beliefs remain unshaken. Sure, they
concede, there has been surprisingly strong productivity growth for
the last three years. Could this represent a break in the trend?
Possibly, they grudgingly admit, but only a tiny shift at best,
they insist.

<p> The real problem, they explain, lies in the composition of the
nation's vast service economy. More than half of all white-collar
workers are what they term "knowledge workers" -- managers,
executives and professionals like doctors, lawyers, teachers, even
economists.

<p> "The work they do does not lend itself to technology-driven
improvements in productivity, and any gains are really difficult to
eke out and are glacial," said Stephen Roach, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Paul David's electrical motor has
nothing to do with the knowledge-intensive process of work in a
service economy."

<p> The real technology cynic at the Fed meeting on Thursday will be
Paul Strassmann, a former chief information officer of Xerox and
the Pentagon. Strassmann, author of "The Squandered Computer,"
published in 1997, believes that corporate America's spending spree
on information technology amounts to an "economic arms race,"
fueled by misguided management theories.

<p> The recent improvement in productivity, according to Strassmann,
is mainly attributable to the lower cost of capital because of low
interest rates. His summary view, though at odds with those of
technology optimists like Brynjolfsson of MIT, may also be received
warmly by the Fed.

<p> "The explanation for the productivity improvement is interest
rates, not information technology," Strassmann said. "The hero
here is not Bill Gates. It's Alan Greenspan."

<p> Yet even Strassmann finds the technology undeniably useful, if
not a productivity elixir. When asked a detailed question, he
replied, "Just look it up on my Web site. It's a lot more
efficient that way."
