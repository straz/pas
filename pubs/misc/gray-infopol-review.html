<h3>Strassmann on Politics and Guidelines</h3>

Paul Strassmann is a leader and seminal thinker in the IS field who 
has held such important posts as CIO of Xerox and the Department of 
Defense. In this self-published volume, the first of what he promises will 
be a trilogy, Strassmann tackles the tough issues of the politics of 
information management and presents a set of guidelines based on his 
long experience.<p>
Strassmann uses the word "politics," but he really wants to talk about 
"governance." He distinguishes between information management and 
information technology and writes that the former, which includes all 
coordination tasks, is the province of the CEO, not the CIO. Thus, the 
CEO is responsible for deciding where and how information systems 
should be applied, and the CIO is responsible for IS effectiveness and 
efficiency. Strassmann therefore believes, for example, that CIOs who 
aspire to chart everyone's work flow are doing the wrong thing and that 
reengineering efforts should not be the responsibility of IS.<p>

The book centers on Strassmann's view that the optimal organization 
is a federation, much as outlined in the US Constitution. In a federation, 
power is balanced between a central unit and a number of constituent 
units, whereas in a confederation all authority remains with the constituent 
units unless they agree to delegate specific powers to the collective 
body. In Strassmann's view, the US is a federation whereas NATO is a 
confederation. Many corporations claim to be federations but are really 
confederations. In such an environment, Strassmann argues, a CIO with a 
federated mission cannot succeed.<p>

Strassmann uses the constitutional model to develop a seven-layer 
information constitution. The top layer is global and includes all functions 
that deal with the outside; the bottom layer is personal and includes all 
data that people want to keep private.<p>

Strassmann presents the layers and proceeds to lay out the elements 
of a model constitution. The basic idea throughout is to achieve a balance 
of power between the center and the divisions. As you read through the 
book, it becomes clear that Strassmann believes that the role of the center 
is essential. In fact, he argues that pure decentralization will fail because 
centralization is required in such areas as security and privacy. On the 
other hand, pure centralization that takes an elitist view and tries a 
trickle-down approach also fails.<p>

Unlike other writers, whose prescriptions for governance tend to 
consist of a few generic slogans, Strassmann presents a remarkably 
detailed model constitution. His prescription covers such wide-ranging 
topics as statements of goals and principles, responsibilities at the 
enterprise, the information management policy board, IS manager, and 
finance. He looks at both the internal and the external relations of IS.
The book is wide ranging and covers most of the topics of concern to 
IS managers. Strassmann presents concepts of operation and standards. 
He prefers process improvement to radical reengineering, and points out 
the folly of massive layoffs that provide short-term financial gain at the 
expense of tearing apart the social fabric of an organization. He looks at 
the issues of legacy systems and reuse; he examines the true cost of client/ 
server arrangements versus mainframes, of training, and of using a 
value-based approach. He also presents a charter for the CIO.<p>

In the last section of the book called "Recollections," Strassmann 
switches gears and takes a look at his own career, which began at General 
Foods in 1961, continued with his long tenure at Xerox, and culminated in 
his more recent stint at the Department of Defense. He points out that in 
politics, "You can never outguess who will ultimately wind up the winner." <p>

In describing his work on the concept of corporate information 
management, which he established at the defense department, he discusses 
not only the problems of implementing management principles but also the 
politics of revamping the department's systems acquisitions process.
In his conclusions, Strassmann returns to the issue of governance. 
Using The Federalist Papers as his model, Strassmann asserts that the 
selection of governance rules is a critical issue that senior managers must 
face on their own, without the help of consultants. Changes in governance 
must be carefully evaluated because they have long-term consequences for 
everyone in the organization.<p>

Two of the delights of the book are the pithy sayings at the beginning 
of each chapter and the "Devil's Dictionary" in the glossary at the end of 
the book. Two of my favorite sayings are:
<ul>
<li>There is no quick long-term fix.<p>
<li>Computerization is the practice of management by other means.
</ul>
All in all, The Politics of Information Management is an important 
book. Although few readers will agree with everything contained in its 500 
pages there is much food for thought here. When Strassmann speaks, IS 
should listen.
