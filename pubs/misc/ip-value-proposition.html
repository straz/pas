<font size="+2">D</font>espite all the journals, reports and seminars which have
been produced on the subject, it remains extremely
difficult for companies to justify their sometimes vast IT
budgets.<p>

It's not exactly a quantitative science. We have all sat
through talks espousing flexible architectures and
state-of-the-art development methodologies - but do they
make profits?<p>

At last, we believe we can provide an answer, courtesy of
Paul Strassmann. Strassmann spent over 30 years working as
chief information officer for the likes of General Foods,
Kraft, Xerox and the US Department of Defence, and has
spent the latter part of his career developing an
innovative set of economic indicators that reveal how
companies spend money on information.<p>

We are convinced that his metrics are the only way to
measure and benchmark the information management
infrastructure of an enterprise.<p>

Established accounting practice is based on a
capital-intensive view of the world. It is designed for
lending organisations and investors to manage their risk.
It is preoccupied with the capital value of a company -
i.e. its value if wound-up. Dead things are valued more
highly than people, skills and ideas, and ratios such as
ROI, ROA and ROE (Return On Investment, Assets and Equity)
quantify the efficiency of a company at creating accounting
profits from capital.<p>

But capital intensive companies only represent about a
quarter of the UK economy; for the other 75 per cent, the
cost of information management has become the biggest input
- such things as management, data analysis, research,
training, information worker salaries, IT and any other
expense that is not accounted for as a product cost.
For an information-intensive company such as a bank, the
salary bill is the biggest single expense. Information
technology is one of the fastest growing components of the
costs of information management and is typically around 10
per cent. Good IT systems improve the productivity of
information workers.<p>

The information-based economy needs metrics that measure
how good a company is at converting those costs of
information management into profit. Strassmann has devised
a simple ratio that he calls information productivity (IP).
It is simply the ratio of the Economic Value-Added (EVA) to
the total cost of information management.<p>

EVA is an established way of expressing the added value the
company generates after paying a reasonable rate of
interest to its share holders. To express this as an
equation:<p>

<table border=0>
<tr><td> <b>Information Productivity</b> = </td>
    <td>Economic Value-Added/<br>
     Cost of Information Management</td></tr></table>

<p>

EVA is a well-understood and accepted accounting value. In
order to make meaningful comparisons between companies it
is important to use a value for the costs of information
management that is in the public domain and not subject to
dispute. Insurance is a highly information-intensive
industry. The Butler Group found that using these metrics,
Britannic came out with an IP rating of 0.18, and was
ranked 36th overall. Legal and General's IP figure was
0.02, and was ranked 674th.<p>

It's clear that IP is a very sensitive indicator. It
penalizes companies with high costs and poor returns.
Companies which report accounting profits that are less
than shareholders could reasonably expect show up as a
negative figure.<p>

There could be any number of reasons for a poor IP rating -
for example, lack of profit-generating lines of business,
excessive management costs or poor IT.<p>

It is easy to jump to erroneous conclusions based on these
figures, like the weekly IT papers did late last year when
they saw that National Westminster Bank was bottom of its
class. They assumed that IT was to blame, but this cannot
be justified from the figures.<p>

Butler Group recommends targeting IT budgets at
revenue-generating activities rather than simply automating
existing business practices. Increasing the numerator in
the information productivity equation has got to be a
better strategy than shaving a percentage point off your
costs; after all, you have had the last decade to install
office automation systems.<p>

Lloyds TSB hit the news headlines recently by putting a
'techie' on the board. For a bank with one of the highest
IP ratings, it should be in a strong position to forge
ahead into e-banking. If it doesn't, First-e will cream off
its best customers before it has finished its pilot study!
It's a fast-moving area to be in and the CIO appointment
reflects the seriousness of the situation. IT is no longer
an automation system to be counted as an overhead.
Internet start-ups are all the rage at the moment. They
typically raise money quickly, investing in slick software
systems to take a slice out of the revenues of established
and slower moving plcs. They can afford to take risks
because they are so small and have little to lose.
Information productivity can't be calculated for them
because there are no published profits. Their business
models can be copied just as quickly by another start-up or
an established plc that can just as easily raise the money
and hire expertise. Fortunes for these guys are as volatile
as ether, but one day they may appear in one of our IP
ranking tables. When they do, their numbers should be
outstanding. Information management costs will be
shockingly low, ensuring that with modest Economic
Value-Added they should shoot to the top of the table.<p>
