<h3><a name=summary></a>Executive summary</h3><p>
<p>
Productivity is the key to management effectiveness: "Without productivity
objectives a business does not have direction; without productivity
measurements it does not have control."  This is Paul Strassmann's starting
point in developing a number of challenging measures of  the value and
productivity of information within an organisation, based on his analysis of
the corporate financial data of thousands of organisations world-wide. His
views on information illuminate much of the work on `Information as an asset'
that the KPMG IMPACT Programme is currently undertaking through the Hawley
committee.<p>
<p>
Paul Strassmann's presentation at the IMPACT Distinguished Seminar held on 27
June 1996 was based on three fundamental beliefs. First, that knowledge and
information are replacing capital as the primary sources of wealth creation, so
that the successful organisation in the 21st century will be one which
cultivates and makes the most of its knowledge and information assets. Second,
that what you measure not only defines what you can manage but also dictates
your management style; third, that information - who owns it or has access to
it - is highly political, and must be managed accordingly.<p>
<p>
He argues that in order to achieve information superiority an organisation must
first understand its assets: the value of its information; how well that
information is being applied; the true cost of its IT. To this end he has
defined measures of information productivity and knowledge capital that can be
used to look at the relative performance of organisations and of divisions
within an organisation. Once an organisation understands the value of its
information assets Strassmann recommends that it establishes a proper strategic
framework for the governance of those assets. He described his model governance
constitution and discussed how proper governance can enhance the performance of
the organisation. Any organisation that attempts to improve its performance by
optimising its processes and its use of resources without a governance
framework risks wasting effort to achieve volatile or ill-conceived goals, and
of failing to understand the true costs or benefits of new systems
developments. <p>
<p>
Strassmann advocates that the role of Chief Information Officer (CIO) for
information management should be as wide-ranging as that of the Chief Finance
Officer (CFO) for the financial management of the organisation. His definition
of information management, which includes <i>all</i> information processes, not
just those which involve IT, is one not currently shared by many Chief
Executives, who more commonly limit the CIO's portfolio to IT processes.
Strassmann regards this short-sightedness as the primary reason why computers
so often fail to deliver the expected results. <p>
<p>
Paul Strassmann's early career with Xerox included periods as chief information
systems executive and vice-president of strategic planning for office
automation. He was Director of Defense Information in the Department of
Defense, where he was responsible for organising and managing corporate
information management for the whole of the Pentagon. He is now an independent
consultant and Distinguished Visiting Professor at the National Defense
University in Washington and at the US Military Academy at West Point.<p>
</ol>
<p>
<h3><a name=measure></a>Information productivity: how do you measure it?</h3><p>
<p>
In an age where information is the key to economic success, information
productivity is vitally important. Yet very little work has been done to
measure it. <p>
<p>
Most CIOs and Boards equate information with information technology. Their
efforts to increase information profitability therefore focus on cutting the
costs of IT, the current emphasis being on outsourcing computer operations and
other non-core activities. Yet Strassmann's analysis of corporate financial
data shows that IT costs the average US industrial company only about 2.5% of
revenue. <p>
<p>
A much more profitable area to address in order to increase productivity is
information management. Strassmann defines information management very broadly,
to cover all activities that allocate, simplify or reduce the costs of
information processes or that increase their effectiveness and quality,
<i>whether or not those processes involve information technology</i>. This
involves coordinating suppliers, employees and customers in tasks that include
managing, training, counselling, coordinating, recording and reporting - all
activities, in fact, that are not directly involved in the production or
delivery of products and services to the customer. (It is for this reason that
the cost of information management is often regarded as `overhead'.)  <p>
<p>
He approximates the cost of information management from company financial
statements as:<p>
<p>
<ol><b>Cost of information management</b><br> = Cost of Sales,
General&amp;Administrative + Cost of Research&amp;Development<p>
</ol>
<p>
His figures show that the average cost of information management is about 25%
of revenue, and growing. He compares this with the cost of capital, which he
defines as:<p>
<p>
<ol><b>Cost of capital</b><br> = (Shareholder equity + Capital surplus) x Interest rate
for equity capital<p></ol>
<p>
He finds that over 80% of US organisations invest more on information than on
capital. This suggests to him that the conventional definition of productivity
as return on capital investment (ie net profit / capital) is inadequate, and
that information is replacing capital as the primary source of wealth creation.
<p>
<p>
Strassmann defines information productivity as the return on information
management costs:<p>
<p>
<ol><b>Information productivity </b><br>= Value added by information /Cost of
information management<p></ol>
<p>
where<p>
<p>
<ol><b>Value added by information</b><br> = Net profit - (Financial capital assets x
Interest rate for borrowing)<p></ol>
<p>
This calculation recognises that capital is a commodity, and deducts the cost
of `paying rent' on it.  In almost half of the US firms that Strassmann has
studied, `value added by information' is negative. A firm may be paying its
managers substantial bonuses based on net profit while failing to exploit its
information. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In the public sector, which doesn't take account of revenue and capital in the
same way, Strassmann's  productivity definition is still valid, but regresses
to:<p>
<p>
<ol><b>Information productivity</b><br> = Cost of operations / Cost of information
management<p></ol>
<p>
Strassmann argues that information is fundamentally different from capital in
that the more you use it the cheaper and more profitable it becomes. For
example, the more Microsoft exploit their customer information to sell new
products, the lower their costs become and the more profit they make.<p>
<p>
He advocates taking regular measurement of information productivity in order to
evaluate trends, to identify the principal causes of misalignment between
information spending and productivity results, and to identify danger areas
where the organisation is doing worse than its competitors. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3><a name=spending>Are you spending the correct amount on IT?</h3></a><p>
<p>
IT's share of total capital expenditure has increased steadily since the 1970s
to the extent that in a significant number of organisations IT spending now
exceeds the value added to the organisation by information. Nevertheless,
Strassmann's measurements show that there is no direct link between IT spending
and return on equity. Neither does he find evidence of the predicted savings in
manpower costs from using IT to flatten organisational hierarchies.<p>
<p>
His measurements do confirm that the number of information workers in an
organisation is directly related to spending on information management
(measured in terms of Sales General &amp; Administrative + R&amp;D), as it is
to IT spending. This is unsurprising, since each information worker increases
the  management overhead and adds to the demand for computer equipment,
infrastructure and  IT support. <p>
<p>
His general equation for IT spending is:<p>
<p>
<ol><b>IT spending</b><br> = a + b*(Cost of Sales General&amp;Administrative) +
c*Profits + d*Desktops + e*Professionals -  f*Executives<p></ol>
<p>
where a,b,c,d,e and f are constants that vary for different industry sectors.
(Strassmann suggests that spending decreases for each executive because it is
already paid for since the executives' high costs are already included in the
Sales, General &amp; Administrative expense line item.)<p>
 <p>
His findings suggest that outsourcing (other than in a carefully chosen
piecemeal fashion) tends to increase IT spending and to decrease information
productivity in the medium term, because it involves `giving away' information
that may be expensive to re-acquire. His findings also confirm the fact (widely
suspected among IT Directors) that an increasing proportion of IT spending is
not covered by the IT budget, but is subsumed into administrative costs.
(Strassmann now routinely adds 22% to the  published IT budget to allow for
this.)<p>
<p>
A CIO needs to be able to compare IT expenditure with that of competitors, both
in absolute terms and in terms of cost per information worker, in order to
assess his/her organisation's effectiveness. It is also useful to compare
divisions within an organisation. <p>
<p>
<p>
<h3><a name=winlose>Information and Knowledge Capital, winners and losers, and why?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
The wealth of an organisation is based on its accumulation of useful knowledge
- its knowledge capital. The value added to an organisation by information,
discussed above under `information productivity' can be regarded as an annual
return on its accumulated knowledge capital. Mirroring the calculation of
financial capital as annual return / interest rate, Strassmann defines and
calculates an organisation's knowledge capital as:<p>
<p>
<ol><b>Knowledge capital</b><br> = value added by information / interest rate for
equity capital<p></ol>
<p>
As we have already seen, information assets often exceed capital assets.
Arguably, therefore, organisations should take the same due care of information
assets as custom, policy and government regulations requires them to take with
capital assets. This is particularly important because knowledge is easy to
steal - both legally by, for example, `poaching' key employees and illegally by
`cyber crime'.<p>
<p>
Knowledge capital clearly resides in the heads of employees, not just in terms
of the skills they possess but also in the relationships they have developed
and in their shared culture and history.  Thus a low staff turnover is likely
to have a double benefit, leading both to a high knowledge capital (provided
that the staff are delivering value from the information they possess) and to
reduced management costs, especially for recruitment and training.<p>
<p>
Knowledge capital also resides in the minds of suppliers, distributors
and customers, for example in the following:<p>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><li>brand-name recognition and trust;<p>
<dd><li>reduced customer costs for using a firm's products and services;<p>
<dd><li>reduced supplier costs by developing a `special' relationship with a firm;<p>
<dd><li>features included in products and services to simplify purchasing decisions.
</ol>
<p>
 <p>
Strassmann believes businesses will be competing in in this area in the future,
as technology allows products and services to be tailored to individual
customers' requirements and preferences and opens up new ways of doing
business. Important examples include the use of the Internet to purchase items
anywhere in the world without currency problems or intermediaries, and
Microsoft's ability to exploit the knowledge capital of its customers (in
locking them into its products as well as in passing onto them much of the cost
for testing new software), which is an important reason for current success. <p>
<p>
Organisations should therefore plan and budget for the accumulation of
knowledge capital to improve their competitive advantage. Conversely,
organisations which diversify into new business areas without quickly acquiring
a knowledge base in these new areas dilute their knowledge capital and suffer
competitively as a consequence. For example, the performance of Federal
Express, whose reputation as a packaging company was one of information
excellence, suffered dramatically after it diversified into air-freight.  <p>
<p>
Strassmann described the use of Bizcase<font size="-4"><sup>TM</sup></font>, a proprietary software
tool that takes a business proposal through strategic planning, project
costing, benefit analysis, risk assessment, comparison with alternative
solutions and business modelling. <p>
<p>
The use of such a standard process for all business proposals can substantially
enhance knowledge capital in a number of ways:<p>
<p>
<dl>
<dd><li>familiarity of presentation style enhances the reader's understanding;<p>
<dd><li>standardisation helps to ensure that nothing is overlooked;<p>
<dd><li>consistency of presentation allows costs and benefits of competing projects
to be compared;<p>
<dd><li>familiarity with the process leads to reduced costs for presenting new
proposals. <p>
</dl>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3><a name=governance>Information governance: how to enhance performance?</a></h3><p>
<p>
The success of an organisation increasingly depends on the speed and
skill with which useful knowledge is acquired, shared and applied. This demands
that managers perform a balancing act between setting  policies to ensure that
corporate information can be used effectively and allowing individuals the
flexibility to innovate. Few organisations set information policy explicitly,
though it is implicit in every casual purchase of a PC and in the development
of every non-standard computer system. As the pervasiveness of information
increases, the possibilities for conflict grow (and so does the size of the
information management budget) and the need to set policy explicitly becomes
stronger. As information replaces capital as the real source of power, the
politics of who owns or has access to information becomes more strident.
Strassmann defines information governance as the creation of structures that
will exercise the required authority over corporate information while reducing
conflict and achieving consensus over its use.<p>
<p>
Within any organisation, the scope of information varies from personal or local
through application or process up to enterprise-wide and beyond, where the
enterprise interfaces with its customers and suppliers. You need variety and
flexibility locally, in order to foster innovation and personal empowerment,
but at higher levels within the organisation information must be subject to
standards that ensure that it is secure and that it can be shared economically
across information systems. The basis for information governance is a
constitutional process that defines suitable constraints for each level in the
organisation. Organisations differ, but in Strassmann's view none requires more
than seven levels of  information. <p>
<p>
Strassmann has designed a model governance constitution that can be adapted and
refined (and in many cases simplified) to suit individual needs. What is
important is that the issues it covers are addressed, that responsibilities are
assigned and that the constitution is enforceable. The constitution should
ideally endure over many changes of management, to provide continuity for the
organisation's knowledge assets.<p>
<p>
The constitution includes:<p>
<dl>
<dd><li>Goals statements that define the concepts of operation of the business and
its supporting information systems in years that are beyond the current budget
planning horizon. Goals are hardly ever attained completely, but provide a
strong framework for the long-term direction of the organisation's information
management.<p>
	eg: <i>Voice, data, video and image information systems shall be
inter-operable so that any authorised employee will be able to retrieve on a
single display information from any source or location.</i><p>
<p>
<dd><li>Specific objectives towards achieving the stated goals.<p>
	eg. <i>By 199x all applications shall run beneath a standard corporate graphic
interface in which every employee has received basic training.</i><p>
<p>
<dd><li>Management policies that define and allocate responsibilities for information
management. These should include  some `parliamentary process' to  allow staff
involvement in policy setting. (All policies should be phrased so that
compliance can be tested.)<p>
	eg <i>A senior executive, reporting to ......, shall be the chief information
officer of the enterprise, with responsibility for the alignment of information
management plans and resources with the approved goals, principles, policies
and objectives. </i><p>
<p>
<dd><li>Policies for the design, implementation, staffing and financial
control of information systems. <p>
	eg <i>Information systems shall be developed and enhanced according to an
enterprise-wide methodology.</i><p>
<i>	All corporate data shall be entered into the Information System only once,
at the point of initial origin; all subsequent uses of such data shall rely on
copies of the original entry.</i><p>
<p>
<dd><li>Planning and finance policies for information.<p>
	eg <i>Business plans must show how information systems contribute to achieving
committed operating results.</i>
</dl>

<p>
<p>
Strassmann stresses the parallel between the scope of responsibility of the CIO
and CFO.  Just as the CFO is accountable for the management, custody,
preservation, integrity, security and assurance of all capital assets, the CIO
should be similarly accountable for all the organisation's information assets.
He believes that it is only a matter of time until the CIO's responsibilities,
like those of the CFO, are enforced by policy or regulation.<p>
