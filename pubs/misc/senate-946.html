<h3>Executive Summary</h3>


The federal government should appoint a Chief Information Officer to fill
the existing vacuum in directing and coordinating information resources
management policies of the government. However, the job should be
structured more like the powers vested in the Chief Financial Officer of
the United States, rather than focused on improving existing information
technology acquisition practices. The Committee should consider augmenting
the Information Technology Management Reform Act with the following
missions:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Recognize the primacy of information resources management by federal
operating executives over the supporting roles of information systems
managers.
<LI>Articulate the roles of the CIO in OMB planning and budget reviews.
<LI>Elevate the importance of outsourcing and privatization to reduce
information systems expenses and to accelerate modernization of information
technologies.
<LI>Emphasize the urgency of information security.
<LI>Focus on the preservation and improved sharing of knowledge how to
improve the effectiveness of information resources.
</ul>

<h3>Oral Presentation</h3>

Mr. Chairman and distinguished member of the Committee. It is an honor and
privilege to be asked by your Committee to testify about the proposed
legislation.<p>
I support the Information Technology Management Reform Act. It offers
significant improvements over existing information management practices in
the Federal government. The appointment of a Chief Information Officer
(CIO) of the United States adopts commercial practices which recognize that
efficient management, protection and preservation of information assets
warrants the oversight by a top-level executive. In many corporations the
position of the CIO is similar to that of the Chief Financial Officer. The
CFO is charged with the efficient management, protection and preservation
of the organization's financial  resources and assets. As I see it, the
role of the CIO is to assure the efficient management, protection and
preservation of all information resources and assets. To this end, I
recommend that the Act be amended to deliver what is truly needed by our
government:<p>

<b>A.</b> The Act should specify in greater detail how the CIO will influence the
management of the government's overall information resources by other means
than exercising oversight over the acquisition of information technology.
In its present form the Act primarily addresses measures which reform the
management of the $5-$8 billion of annual information technology
acquisition expenses. Very little attention is paid to controlling and
guiding information resources management practices that are estimated to
cost over $200 billion per annum, once the acquisitions are completed.
Fixing deficiencies in the current acquisition process is fine, but that
misses the point of where the principal benefits from any reform in
information resources would come from. Right now the estimated total annual
costs of maintaining the government's information resources are over twenty
five times greater than the annual cost of acquiring information
technologies.<p>

<b>B.</b> The Act should provide more explicit guidance on the roles and
responsibilities of the CIO for outsourcing and privatization of
information technologies. In the next few years outsourcing initiatives
will surely exceed the funds spent on acquiring new systems. At present the
Act focuses on reforming acquisition procedures and omits much needed
direction on how to integrate what is left after most of the information
technologies and information systems are managed by contractors.<p>

<b>C.</b> The Act must address more thoroughly policies and roles of the CIO in
minimizing the demonstrated vulnerability of information systems to
disruption, corruption and destruction. Before corporate CIOs are allowed
to introduce improvements through innovative and modern systems, they must
first be able to answer if what is already on hand will survive and
function as expected. I estimate the current accumulated installed value of
computer operations in the Federal government to be well in excess of a
half trillion dollars. If federal computers cease to function, the damage
to the safety and well-being of our Nation could be a large multiple of
that amount. The proposed Act as now written does not adequately
acknowledge the severity of threats to government operations from
information crime and information terrorism. Until that is remedied by
insertion of Sections that will specifically empower the CIO to deal with
matters related to information security, this new office will be open to
public and Congressional censure as soon as there is a major breach in the
security of government information systems.<p>

<b>D.</b> The Act must explicitly address the preservation and improved sharing of
intellectual assets held by the government that are embodied in the
accumulations of software, databases, archival files and personal knowledge
which is represented in the understanding of business processes by
experienced and highly trained government workers.<p>

It is fine to accumulate comprehensive records on contractor performance
and to assure completion of projects on time and on schedule as currently
detailed in the Act. It is far more important to ensure that each unit of
our government benefits from our information resources investments by
sharing the accumulated knowledge about information management practices in
an open, accessible, timely and equitable manner. The Act does not offer
the necessary principles, policies, institutional changes and financial
means for achieving an information technology infrastructure that would
compare favorably with those enjoyed by some of the largest corporations. I
find that large multinational organizations achieve their largest savings
and gains in effectiveness through sharing their knowledge how to simplify
and standardize basic business processes rather than by placing most of
their emphasis on how information technologies are procured.<p>

Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request that the balance of my testimony which
supports the oral presentation be entered into the Record. Thank you.<p>

<h3>Supporting Testimony</h3>

<h3>A. Unbalanced Expectations of what the CIO is Supposed to Accomplish</h3>

The Act accurately defines the concepts of "Information Resources",
"Information Resources Management," "Information Systems," and "Information
Technology."<p>

The 1995 "Information Resources" for the Federal Government are at least
$200 billion. Most of this amount is for salaries and benefits of federal
employees who collect, process, maintain, use, disseminate and dispose of
information. Information technology represents only about 13% of that
amount, accounting for approximately $7,200 of expense per Federal
employee. This is comparable in magnitude to per capita expenditures for
commercial organizations that perform similar business functions.
If the Federal Government is not severely overspending or under-spending
for information technologies, why then call for an Information Technology
Management Reform Act? Will fixing the information technology acquisition
process - which indeed has much merit - deliver to taxpayers more effective
information management for a government which is largely an information
enterprise?<p>

Government computers, as quoted from a paper issued by this Committee, do
not "...detect fraud in federal student loans," "...prevent excess
inventories at the Defense Department,", "...collect millions in civil
penalties or billions in overdue tax bills," and "...detect rampant fraud
in Medicare programs." Only organizations that have organized their human
administrative and technology systems processes into a well integrated
whole can accomplish that. Computers are dumb and do only what they are
programmed to do. The programs are supposed to reflect what managers
require. That does not seem to work well in the federal government because
of fundamental flaws in its present information resources management
practices.<p>

Mischief and malfunctions in government operations are largely attributable
to faulty information resource management practices, such as business
processes that have never been subject to reengineering. There are hardly
any computer mistakes because technical reliability of 99.9% is not only
achievable, but can demonstrate mean-time-to failure well in excess of ten
years. When systems failures are reported they can be always traced to
managerial mistakes, faulty business processes and lapses in elementary
good housekeeping.<p>

While Director of Defense Information I could demonstrate in a large number
of cases that unit cost operating savings of up to 70% were attainable over
a seven year time period. Over three quarters of these savings had nothing
to do with information technology. They were obtainable primarily from
streamlining and consolidation of redundant functions and from business
process redesign. Only after information resources management had delivered
reformed business practices did it make any sense to computerize what
remained.<p>

The glaring malfeasance that GAO writes about are managerial and
organizational failures first and foremost. In successful commercial
businesses information technology professionals and contractors are very
likely to deliver what is contracted for, especially if there are
additional financial incentives to do so. In successful firms the
accountability and responsibility for information resources management
resides in the hands of operating managers. "Line" management remains
accountable for benefits. Computer specialists are held accountable only
for a small share of total information resource costs. Successful firms do
not abdicate the management of information resources to technology experts.
I do not think that the Federal Government should conduct its affairs
otherwise.<p>

Computers should not be budgeted and justified as separate functional line
items by CIOs. Computers should be proposed, budgeted and justified by
operating managers as catalytic contributors to achieving their business
improvement plans. A CIO should not be asked to explain the benefits from
computer investments or to explain how the overall computer budget of a
firm relates to a firm's profits. Only business managers who balance all
resources can do that.<p>

The Act should not legislate that Federal and Agency Chief Information
Officers become solely accountable to the President and to the Congress for
the government's information resources. You should not expect CIOs to be
solely accountable for directing and improving these resources. We do need
CIO's, but their primary job should be to provide the leadership in showing
how such accountability and responsibility for the $200 billion of
information resources can be delivered by each Federal manager. After that
is accomplished, you can then demand that the CIOs guide the $5-6 billion
of annual information technology acquisition expenses so that the remaining
$20 billion per annum for information technology operating and maintenance
expenses are efficient, of high quality and responsive to the needs of the
diverse customer constituencies.<p>

In the information age information resource management is inseparable from
all other acts of management. Effective information resources management
always should come first in organizational priority, efficient information
systems designs and architectures come second and information technology
acquisition must come last. Unfortunately, many unsuccessful corporations
learn this lesson too late. I believe that one should render to managers
the responsibilities of management, and render unto the CIOs only that
which is the CIO's.<p>

Improved information resource management will not arise as the result of an
improved computer technology acquisition process. That is what was wrong
with the Brooks Act. While the original intention was to force an
improvement in the efficiency of information resources by means of unique
and stringent acquisition regulations, in actual practice it regressed to
its lowest and least relevant common denominator.<p>

I do not underestimate the cultural change that will be necessary to
transform government managers, who have been reluctant to learn how to
manage information technologies for the past forty years. One of the
principal missions of the federal CIO is to make it possible for all
federal managers to become proactive owners of their own information
processes, whether computerized or not. Technology has now progressed so
that operating managers can articulate their information requirements with
confidence what they need, without having to master the details of how that
may be accomplished. This hold true especially if the systems innovation
cycle is kept much shorter than the managerial learning cycle.
I recommend that you consider improving this Act to better balance the
responsibilities between the CIOs and agency managers. After studying S.
946 I concluded that you expect too much from the new CIO position. The Act
does not place the appropriate responsibility on information resources
management where investment justification and budget accountability must
always belongs.<p>

<h3>B. Insufficient Guidance In Managing Outsourcing</h3>

The investigative report of this Committee of October 12, 1994 "Computer
Chaos: Billions Wasted Buying Federal Computer Systems" correctly focuses
on the flawed acquisition processes for major contracted information
systems. The report did not diagnose why the federal government does not
possess adequate means to manage outsourced information systems. The report
failed to reveal that it was not only the acquisition process that was
faulty, but that systems malfunctioned after they were finally delivered.
The federal government's neglect can be found through the absence of
attention to business process improvement methods, organizational design,
benchmarking comparisons with best business practices and metrics that
would highlight the lack of productivity of government information
processes. Inadequate attention has been given to encouraging the
disciplines that would improve information resources management
The government has also neglected disciplines that would yield improved
information systems designs, such as common information systems
architectures, integrated computer-aided systems engineering tools, common
data elements, data models, common graphic interfaces, software
portability, shared communications protocols and systems integration
criteria are particularly absent.<p>

Instead, attention was focused on the ends - procurement of information
technologies  - and the not the means, which concern information resources
management practices and systems design policies. The proposed Act falls
short in remedying these deficiencies.<p>

The cause of the "Computer Chaos" is the existing policy of treating each
systems acquisition as a separate and discrete event with its own
contract-specific technology solution. This has resulted in thousands of
unintegrated, hard-to-maintain, impossible to manage contractor-dependent
islands of automation. The legislation proposed by this Committee deals
exhaustively with reforming the acquisition process for individual
contracts. It does not add or specify sufficient powers to be held in the
reformed system that would remedy the current inadequacies in managing the
interoperability across systems that must ultimately link with each other.
There is nothing in the Act that prescribes policies that mandate resource
sharing. Even if the acquisition process is reformed, any unforeseen
systems faults would become amplified after the system is finally delivered
and then outsourced again for operations and maintenance. Given the way the
Act is now written, what would be authorized as well controlled, but
independent procurements, would become hard to manage as entrenched islands
of agency specific methods and technologies.<p>

This lack of a balanced policy is demonstrated nowhere as acutely as in the
neglect of this Act to deal with matters of outsourcing and privatization
of information services. Other legislation now pending in Congress calls
for increasing the share of information technology to be contracted out to
commercial vendors. Before any new legislation mandates such action, it
should address how to manage the outsourcing of information technologies
and how to harmonize the resulting operations with principles articulated
in the Information Technology Management Reform Act. The CIO positions
established by this Act are likely to spend more time in the next few years
grappling with matters of outsourcing strategies than with any other issue.
In the absence of explicit authority in this Act that empowers the CIOs to
issue outsourcing policies, regulations, guidelines and policies, the
effectiveness and the relevance of the CIO will be degraded. To highlight
the importance of this matter, let me note the following facts:
<UL>

<LI>According to a 1995 report by the Electronic Industry Association 75% of
the federal government's 1995 information technology budget of $25.4
billion is already contracted out to the private sector.
<LI>Only 25% of the total information technology budget remains for in-house
(e.g. "organic") government costs. This is accounted mostly by personnel
and operating costs of already installed equipment;
<LI>48% of the total federal information technology budget is contracted out
for services, mostly for telecommunications, systems applications and
development, maintenance and operations;
<LI>5% of the budget is contracted out for software purchases and fees;
<LI>22% of the budget is contracted for equipment purchases, leases and site
support.
</ul>

None of these budget categories includes an additional $12.3 billion of
information technology in Department of Defense's "mission-related"
systems, research and development information technology and expenses by
"other" federal agencies not reported as information technology expenses to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The budget cited does not
include sizable information technology expenses for intelligence support,
security monitoring, and computers identified as supporting weapons systems
platforms. The total amount of information technology expenses not reported
by OMB surely exceeds the official number. Depending on how the delegation
of the federal CIOs authority is defined in the Act, and how it is
interpreted in watered down administrative interpretations, the prospective
federal CIOs may be guiding toward outsourcing only a fraction of the over
$40 billion of the total estimated federal  information technology expense.<p>

The Information Technology Management Reform Act as currently written does
not adequately address policies that assure that the federal government
will effectively manage, coordinate and integrate information systems which
are contracted out to commercial vendors. The Act does not prescribe what
must remain as the government's core competencies  and must remain inside
the government as a responsibility for information resource management. The
Act addresses in adequate detail how new systems are to be acquired by the
federal government. It does not articulate what to do with what is already
in place and what happens after new systems are installed. It does not
specifically and constructively indicate the CIOs' roles to manage and
integrate information resources which will increasingly reside in the hands
of contractors. I favor the maximum amount of outsourcing of government
information services to commercial enterprises, as long as one recognizes
that contractors have good reasons to pursue their own technology choices,
data definitions, systems design tools and unique solutions.<p>

As currently written, this Act may succeed in eliminating much of the
existing regulatory "Chaos of Acquisition" only to become saddled with a
more costly "Chaos of Operations." Therefore the Act should include
explicit principles and guidelines that stipulate how the CIOs shall pursue
the achievement of interoperable and innovative outsourced systems that
take advantage of shared economies. Specifically, the Act should empower
the CIO to direct the delegation of functional tasks to inter-departmental
"executive agents" on behalf of commonly shared processes that reach across
existing lines of government organization. Such executive agents should be
empowered to solicit contractor consortia for delivering support services
for government-wide processes, similar to those existing in the commercial
sector which support shared finance, personnel, logistics, transportation,
telecommunications, cash management or  banking functions.<p>

In the information age the management of information resources is an
essential attribute of the powers that every manager must have to exercise
the essential duties of management. One can rent, contract out, sublet,
license and delegate information technology. I subscribe to the idea that
the commercial sector should perform that function to the fullest extent
possible. But, I do not believe that oversight and integration of systems
into synergistic and well-functioning management processes can and should
be outsourced. You can manage with artificial limbs, kidney dialysis, or
even a heart transplant, but not without your native-grown brain.<p>

Any information technology outsourcing or privatization legislation should
specify what functions, safeguards, capabilities and staff skills must be
retained within the federal government before contractors may be employed
to perform defined tasks. Guiding outsourcing policy should be one of the
principal obligations of the Chief Information Officer of the United
States.<p>

The proposed Act should also articulate what are the human resource and
managerial prerequisites that must be satisfied by each federal agency
before an agency may be allowed to outsource mission-critical elements. The
Act should specify the policies and safeguards that must be in place so
that outsourcing actions will not result in short-term cost-reduction
practices that impede or disrupt the ability of the federal government
managers to function in the long run.<p>

I have just completed a study of twelve of the largest commercial
information technology outsourcing contracts awarded in the last four
years. The evidence is overwhelming in that during the recent rush to
downsize corporations, outsourcing was applied as just another means to
shrink employment. Even though individual savings contributed by individual
contracts may have been attractive, it did not follow that the performance
of the organization as a whole improved. You may gain efficiency by
outsourcing data centers only to discover that the ability to introduce
business process innovations is crippled because of rigid contractual terms
that favor efficiency over responsiveness.<p>

A policy of outsourcing isolated bits of information processing
technologies to realize lower costs for information technologies is not
likely to deliver more effective information resource management to the
government. Therefore, one of the principal roles of the prospective
federal CIO should be to view outsourcing activities as a part of a
coordinated effort that assures that each outsourcing move will contribute
to a more effective government overall, both immediately and in the likely
future.<p>

This Act should stipulate that the CIO has the responsibility for directing
that information systems outsourcing services become an enhancement that
enables continued innovation and improvement initiatives by the
government's operating executives who must remain accountable for
delivering government services.<p>


<h3>C. Inadequate Protection of Increasingly Vulnerable Systems</h3>

The present functioning of federal government information systems can be
seriously degraded, to the point of failure, by intrusions launched by
technologically sophisticated attackers who use advanced software
engineering methods in truly elegant ways. The most severe threat comes
from experts whose interests are either terrorist or criminal. This
suggests that the government CIO must exercise aggressive leadership
coupled with the creation of a central coordinating authority with strong
links to the private sector.<p>

Ensuring the security, integrity and availability of information maintained
on the government's systems must become one of the key responsibilities of
the Chief Information Officer. The CIO of the United States must ensure
that the federal government commits a significant share of its information
systems resources to improving the integrity of the infrastructure that
supports all government information processing operations. This calls for
adopting realistic risk management practices throughout the government
because interdependence, resource-sharing and consolidation increases
vulnerability. I find nothing in the proposed Act which indicates that
security matters deserve high priority attention from the CIO.<p>

For example, the Act contains an extensive Section that deals with the
maintenance of detailed records about contractor performance. The damage
that can be inflicted by a single well-placed infoterrorist attack on a
critical government information system can exceed the costs of contractor
incompetence by a large multiplier. Yet, there is no indication in the Act
that the Office of the CIO would collect, analyze and pursue incidents when
information security infractions are detected. This unbalanced view about
CIO priorities must be corrected by amending the Act to include the
responsibility for the CIO to maintain and monitor compliance with
information assurance policies.<p>

Groups of knowledgeable and experienced people exist today within the
federal government as well as in the private sector who are able to
characterize the threats and can install practical countermeasures against
information attacks. Presently, efforts which foster information assurance
and security are diluted due to organizational differences, competing
interests and disincentives to cooperate. As a result, whatever
coordination in achieving information security that does exist today tends
to be ad hoc and often dissipates the talents that could be applied to a
coherent and decisive security effort.<p>

The Act should define the CIO's leadership, policy roles and authority for
coordinating information security assurance. Because of the sensitivities
of the U.S. public to the role of government, it is imperative that this
authority be constituted in such a way that the CIO will not infringe,
without legal sanctions, on privacy rights and civil liberties.<p>

The following information security functions and responsibilities should be
defined in the proposed Act for the Office of the CIO with regard to
governmental information systems security:
<UL>
<LI>Policy, leadership, goal-setting and advocacy for information assurance
and protection, including advocacy of information systems assurance to
Congress;
<LI>Coordinating information security policies and activities of Departments
and Agencies already having specific responsibilities in their respective
areas, such as the Federal Reserve Board, the FAA, the Treasury Department,
the FCC, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense and the
Intelligence Community. A special relationship between the CIO and the
National Security Agency must be defined;
<LI>Working with law enforcement and intelligence organizations for threat
awareness and vulnerability assessment of both the government and
commercial sectors, whenever the commercial sectors perform information
processing services for the government;
<LI>Planning, budgeting and programming guidance to government agencies on
matters related to information systems security;
<LI>Guidance on regulation, directives, processes and standards that would
apply not only to the government but to the commercial infrastructure that
supports the government's information systems needs;
<LI>Facilitating joint industry and government planning on dealing with
threats to national interests from potential compromises of the
government's information infrastructure;
<LI>Ensuring that adequate information security training and education is
delivered to everyone responsible for managing and using the government's
information systems.
<LI>Issuing guidelines that define the accountability of operating managers
for making the tradeoffs between the risks and the costs of safeguards.
Make information security a responsibility of general management. Do not
allow it to be completely delegated to information technologists.
<LI>Coordination of technology applications and sponsorship of prototype
solutions;
<LI>Definition of the principles to guide an information systems security
architecture for the government, especially as it applies to multilevel
security;
<LI>Validation, verification and reporting of protective or countermeasure
solutions, whether technical or administrative; and,
<LI>Setting policies information, security related practices and standards
such as encryption methods and practices, endorsement of configuration
control tools and methods and selection of technical means for assuring
compliance with information security policies.
</UL>

I consider that the omission of the above policies from the proposed
Information Technology Management Reform Act degrades its utility in
improving the use of information systems in the service of government. The
best I can say in the defense of the existing computer systems chaos is
that it is as confusing and intractable to potential adversaries as it is
to government officials and systems users. At present computer chaos is one
of the government's best defenses.<p>

The proponents of this Act should realize that there is a price to be paid
for streamlining, consolidation, standardization and outsourcing. Increased
systems integration without increased emphasis on security is a
prescription for disaster. Just as efficiency and integration permit those
with a legitimate need and authorization to access needed information, they
permit those without such authorization to obtain crucial and sensitive
information. Not only cyber-terrorists and hackers pose a risk to federal
information systems, but white collar businesses seeking an information
advantage over competition. Information warfare is already waged on the
economic front where technology competitors, foreign governments, foreign
intelligence services and criminal elements with money to launder seek
every advantage by exploiting security vulnerabilities of the government's
information systems.<p>

Unless increased vulnerability is offset by reliable protective means  and
well directed policies and practices under the leadership of the federal
CIO, the benefits of reforms may be overwhelmed by their risks. Information
security must be designed in the federal information systems at the outset.
Responsibility for ensuring that responsible information security practices
are both developed and practiced must be coordinated through a high level
office. The CIO of the federal government must have the charter for
reviewing government regulations, policies and procedures to ensure that
they are designed to protect the integrity and security of the information
maintained on federal systems.<p>

If the distinguished members of this Committee think that my statements are
unduly alarming let me assure you that based on my personal knowledge I
feel completely justified in asserting that there is a clear and present
danger to the security of the United States when some or most of the
government's computers will cease to function. When we encounter the
equivalent of an "Information Pearl Harbor" aimed at a government
information system, Congress will surely look for accountability in setting
overall information systems security policy. If Congress chooses to pass an
Act to appoint the CIO of the United States, it should not be remiss in
making clear what is expected of the CIO in this regard.<p>

I did not say <strong>"if"</strong> a devastating event will happen. I said 
<strong>"when,"</strong> because
it is only a matter of time before crippling threats to the information
integrity of the federal government  will take place.<p>

<h3>D. Inadequate Concern About Safeguarding Knowledge Assets</h3>

Long-term knowledge assets of any organization are:
<dl>
<dd>1. The experienced workforce;
<dd> 2. Effective business processes; and
<dd>3. Trusted data that represents the organizational memory of the government.
</dl>
To conserve these requires a planning horizon in building the capabilities
of information resources of more than ten years. In the case of data, one
has to look ahead more than twenty years because major changes in data
definitions are unaffordable. Software logic that represent elements of
business processes can be expected to retain their utility for decades. It
takes a lifetime to hire and nurture an experienced and competent
workforce.<p>

The Information Technology Management Reform Act elaborates in great detail
how to acquire rapidly obsolescent information technology, but neglects
sustaining and enhancing our knowledge as a long term asset of the
government. The Act does not articulate information resource management
policies on how to manage the accumulation of useful new knowledge and how
to preserve what already exists. Instead, it focuses on making better
technology choices when making initial information technology acquisition
decisions.<p>

One of the primary missions of the federal CIO should be to shape policies
and influence legislation that establish and preserve information
investments that will have payoffs well beyond the short-term budget and
election cycles. The Act currently does not specifically require the CIO to
provide leadership in the formulation of policies that will result in  the
conservation of information systems assets.<p>

It would be advisable for the Act to include Sections that specifically
assign to the Office of the CIO responsibilities for tasks such as
illustrated below:<p>

<h4>D.1 Reusable Software</h4>
Reusable software offers the single largest cost-reduction opportunity in
the governments information technology budget. Hardware expenses have
shrunk to less than 15% of typical information systems expenses for an
agency. From now on, what matters in making information technology
effective is software. By far the most decisive influence in managing the
costs of systems is the competence with which the federal government
manages its inventory of software, business process designs and data
archives. The current Act's overemphasis on the acquisition of bargain
hardware will not have much of an effect on total information resource
costs. Putting pressure on unreasonable reductions in hardware costs will
surely increase software, operating, support and user expenses.<p>

To sustain a long and useful life, software must be portable from one
computer to another. An acceptable level of portability exists when over
90% of application logic can relocate, without a major investment, to a new
computing and operating system environment. The need for such high levels
of portability comes from the imperative of preserving organizational
knowledge that is embodied into software.<p>

Acquisition managers and contractors usually do not think in such
farsighted terms because they do not expect to be around when the benefits
from software reuse arise. "Scrap and patch" is easier and often less
rewarding than "build and recycle."<p>

Therefore, the role of the CIO as currently described in the Act should be
augmented to guide, and if necessary mandate, the construction, application
and utilization of reusable software. The CIO should ensure that the
government maintains software and business process "repositories" so that
it does not have to pay for identical intellectual products many times over
for each acquisition. The inventory of government owned or
government-licensed intellectual products ought to facilitate the ability
of contractors to lower their prices for systems to be delivered to
government agencies, because they will be able to build upon what has come
before and not incur the costs for reinventing what has been already paid
for.

<h4>D.2 Standardization of Systems Engineering Protocols</h4>

To preserve valuable training, data, and software resources the government
will need systems engineering tools that manage these long-term
investments. Proper systems tooling allows the adoption of a "snap-in,
snap-out" approach to technology insertion. This requires a high level of
standardization of protocols and data formats which determine how
intellectual products are connected with a knowledge "repository" and the
available for linking with new applications.<p>

In other words, the objective here is to make it possible for an obsolete
workstation to uncouple from a network, so that a new one can take over
without disruption. Standard systems engineering protocols should make it
feasible to operate in diverse systems environments that meet the
government-approved linking standards.<p>

To achieve this flexibility requires the government to approve integrated
computer-aided system engineering methods and data dictionaries that make
it possible for contractors to compete in mixing and matching a wide range
of computer models, using diverse operating systems that support a defined
range of computer languages. Standardization of systems engineering
protocols will make it easier to deliver mission-supporting information
technologies that would continue to function through the transient
phenomena of rapidly changing generations of hardware technology or
versions of operating systems.<p>

Without emphatic CIO leadership the acquisition and adoption of such
systems methods will not happen. Therefore, this Act must explicitly state
that the role of the CIO should be to guide, and if necessary mandate, the
construction, application and utilization of reusable standard software
engineering methods by government employees as well as contractors. The Act
must be explicit how such policies become actionable and enforceable.

<h4>D.3 Business Process Improvement</h4>

The gap in the current understanding by information technologists of what
is needed to support rapid improvements in business processes is perhaps
the chief reason why operating executives are dissatisfied with information
systems support organizations. This misunderstanding is underscored by
typically large annual expenditures for systems maintenance which often
amount to more than 20% of the initial information technology development
budget.<p>

I view most of "maintenance" expenses as "development" cost overruns.
Whenever a contractor is asked to make major changes in the logic of a
program after the system is delivered, or launches on major integration
efforts with other installed applications, I consider that to be a clue
that business process improvement initiatives had not been properly matched
to information systems development efforts. What usually masquerades as
large maintenance expense is really an effort to patch over fundamental
problems in design because the business process improvement effort became
de-coupled from the information systems development process. The fault for
this situation lies in the ambiguous language of the business managers, who
are concerned with workflow, bureaucratic privileges and organizational
relationships, as contrasted with the abstract logic of the systems people,
who focus on procedures and systematic communications.<p>

Policy guidance for business process improvement in the federal government
should not be assigned to the CIO office. Business process improvement must
rely on functional expertise. It involves tradeoffs that transcends
information resources management concerns. In business process improvement
projects information technology assumes usually only a small, even though
catalytic role. Therefore, the CIO should concentrate principally on the
introduction and promotion of methods that would seamlessly carry from the
specification of functional objectives, though an exploration of
alternatives, to the systematic construction of improved logic in
computers.<p>

The proposed Act should define the role of the CIO in specifying how
business process improvement methods link with information systems designs,
but not more than that. The Act should make clear that the expertise of the
CIOs will concentrate on seeing to it that workflow descriptions as well as
data models generated as by-products of business process improvement are
captured as key elements in a "knowledge repository" of the government. The
Act should not demand responsibilities from the CIO that have been
explicitly reserved as  roles of the government's operating managers

<h4>D.4 Open Systems</h4>

As systems evolve, they should be designed and constructed to fit into a
technological infrastructure that is independent of administrative
processes and of proprietary practices by contractors or vendors. Open
systems are desirable not only because they enable purchasing competitively
priced equipment, but because they make it possible to develop information
systems independently of technological and business changes. Open systems
enable the rapid introduction of incremental operational changes without
having to worry about the simultaneous insertion of technological
innovation at the same time. Open systems are necessary to reduce the
dependence of government agencies on super-large and one time revolutionary
changes in favor of evolutionary adaptations that match the learning
capacity of people.<p>

The adoption of open systems standards offers an opportunity to preserve
the value of the accumulated training and software knowledge of everyone
who has contributed to government information systems over several
generations of technological improvement. However, instituting technical
openness as defined by CIO-promulgated software and communications
technical standards is not sufficient. The increased volatility in how
government organizations conduct their affairs calls for flexible designs
that can absorb the shocks of consolidation, reorganization, privatization,
centralization, decentralization, restructuring, realignment, reengineering
and re-inventing. The design of information systems must be sufficiently
robust to avoid expending large sums every time there is a major change in
the scale or scope of operations. Open systems design must offer not only
technological adaptability, but also much greater resilience in coping with
rapidly changing conditions than is currently the case with systems
projects that implement rigid specifications.<p>

Pursuing open systems solutions is applicable to much more than computers.
It is one of the most important policies for guiding the practice of
information resources management, especially as it applies to training and
developing the skills of government employees. Open systems offer a way to
conserve general systems skills, since an employee does not have to track
the technical minutiae of a rapidly changing marketplace. The payoffs from
preserving and diversifying this knowledge capital are enormous because it
enables government employees to be more responsive to government and
customer needs, without having to become technical experts. My biggest
problem with the Act is its omission of policies and guidance about the
personal skills and career plans for civil service employees who will have
to implement its provisions.<p>

The greatest benefit of open systems is defined by what economists call the
"residual value" of an investment. Extending the useful operating life of
information systems offers greater economic life-cycle gains than perhaps
any other influence. However, much of the current competitive contracting
practices tend to favor rapid break-even periods, which is inconsistent
with long residual values. The Act should state that one of the primary
objectives of the Office of the CIO is to ensure that short-term budgetary
incentives do not override lasting benefits to the government.<p>

The immediate rationale for pursuing open systems, which is the
preservation of knowledge, extends beyond adopting technical standards,
which have been already assigned to the CIO in the proposed Act. The
pending legislation should assign a much more comprehensive role to the CIO
in becoming the chief advocate and guardian of open systems solutions. This
influence will affect how agencies will coordinate their information
resources across the entire federal government, and facilitate their
sharing of proven business practices and processes. Open systems make it
possible to break the contractual impediments that presently make it
difficult for government agencies to enter into information
technology-sharing arrangements. Open systems also inhibit the erection of
proprietary barriers that are now created by systems contractors who must
minimize their costs while maximizing their freedom to control what they
do.<p>

Open communications that connect inter-related governmental systems must
allow for knowledge to be shared globally, irrespective of the
technological conditions found locally. The institution of open systems
solutions is mandatory to make computer-mediated work feasible and
independent of agency, geographic location or functional specialization.
Unless the proposed Act makes it possible for the CIO to enforce the
adoption of open systems standards, the new position may not fulfill its
promise of making available to information resources managers not only
improved acquisition processes, but improved capabilities that are the
essential characteristic  of any well directed information resources
organization.<p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

The placement of the U.S. CIO in the Executive Office of the President, as
part of the Office of Management and Budget, is appropriate. It is a
welcome change which fills a policy-making vacuum in a function that is
critical to the functioning of effective government. The Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) is already in OMB, because commercial, regulatory and
fiduciary practices have recognized the responsibilities of the CFO for
seeing to it that the recording, reporting and custodianship of corporate
assets are an extension of the powers vested in the office of the Chief
Executive.<p>

Generally accepted financial reporting practices do not presently include
measuring and publishing data about the value of accumulated information
assets, such as the knowledge of employees, software and data. Yet the
value of these assets now exceed reported tangible assets for over 80% of
U.S. industrial corporations. Since the Federal government is almost
entirely an information-based enterprise, the proposed Act should address
as much the role of the CIOs as the fiduciary reporters about the custody
of knowledge assets, as it concerns their roles in reducing acquisition and
operating costs. The language of the Act should be revised to define the
fundamental purpose of the CIO position in terms that are equivalent to
those of the CFO.<p>

Just a year ago the GAO reported to the Committee on Government Operations
of the House of Representatives about the progress made in the first 3 1/2
years since the implementation of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act.
This GAO report stands out in its praise of the accomplishments of the
Office of the CFO in instituting reforms that resulted in material
improvements in government operations. I have examined this GAO report as
well as other documents that relate to the effectiveness of the position of
the CFO of the U.S. Government. I think that much can be learned from this
experience of how that job was structured and from its track record.
Perhaps the most important insight one can gain by comparing the relative
stability and security of the jobs of corporate CFOs as compared with the
rapid turnover and career instability of corporate CIOs. This concerns
methods by which each of these executives project their organizational
influence and power.<p>

The CFOs have learned to leverage their roles by being recognized as close
and trusted advisors of their Chief Executives. The CFOs have well defined
fiduciary tasks as custodians of financial assets. They exercise influence
through a network of appointees who can be relied to implement their
central policy guidance locally. If a dictate is necessary, that is always
conveyed through operating management where the direct accountability for
results resides. Effective CFOs concentrate on mandating what ought to be
done at times when plans and budgets for the entire enterprise are under
review.<p>

Most CIOs are only rarely seen as trusted advisors of their Chief Executive
because they mostly do not have a well defined set of fiduciary
responsibilities. In the absence of  an adequate charter, such CIOs tend to
exercise their influence through monopolistic power over the acquisition
and custody of computers and telecommunications. This makes the CIOs' power
rest on case by case interventions since they do not have the charter to
assess the effectiveness of the uses of information resources.
To fulfill the objective of achieving a substantial improvement in the
delivery of information systems in support of the government, this Act
should reflect many of the lessons learned from the ways the CFO of the
United States and the CFOs of commercial enterprises operate. That will
make the CIO of the United States a constructive addition to improving the
management of the federal government in the information age.
