<blockquote>
Paul A. Strassmann has jokingly referred to himself as "a cast iron,
Establishment, corporate-bureaucrat kind of a business computer
creature."... There's no doubting his credentials for that claim;
during the past 35 years he has served as Chief Information Officer
for General Foods, Kraft Foods, Xerox, even the Pentagon (the latter
during the Bush Administration, controlling a $10 billion dollar
budget!).<p>

In fact, Mr. Strassmann is anything but an MIS technocrat of narrow
horizons; he is also an MIT-trained engineer, entrepreneur, document
collector, consultant, West Point professor, and the author of four
books. His intellectual interests encompass political theory,
history, economics, and related topics. This is Part I of an
interview done with Dan Doernberg in December 1994.<p>

<p>

CLB: When did you first work with computers?<p>

Strassmann: The first time I saw a computer was in a course I took at
Harvard in 1953. I started working with computers at MIT in 1954, so
this was as early as you can get; in fact, my 1955 Masters
dissertation at MIT's Sloan Business School was the first in the
nation on a commercial application of computers. I took punched cards
from the New Jersey Turnpike and devised a method for scheduling toll
collection personnel.<p>

CLB: Your latest book, _The Politics of Information Management_
(1995), touches on many themes that you've written about before; how
does it fit into the body of work you've produced over the years?<p>

Strassmann: I've always been preoccupied with the maintenance of
civilized society, as I've seen with my own eyes how even an advanced
one can disintegrate. I have witnessed, in the Nazi and Soviet cases,
how bureaucracies can be organized to execute socially destructive
missions, and how they can run amok if they seize enough power to
pursue criminality without any restraints whatsoever.<p>

CLB: You've always had a very ecological view of business; thoroughly
analyze the customers and competitors, identify the relevant assets,
strategize, and then act.<p>

Strassmann: My intellectual heritage is cybernetics. You may recall
that in the 1940's Norbert Wiener started examining how self-adaptive
capabilities function in biological organisms as well as in
engineering servomechanisms. It encompasses the entire cycle of how an
organism learns, governs, and adjusts so that it may survive and maybe
even prosper. Wiener's followers tried to comprehend how socially
constructed entities, as well as biological ones, manage to adapt to
changing conditions, and how they evolve by linking their internal
control mechanisms to the external realities.  I started applying
feedback theories in work that I did for General Foods in the 1960s.
In those days you could find logistical anomalies, e.g. our Atlanta
warehouse had a 40 year supply of 3 oz. lime Jell-O, but Jell-O has a
shelf life of only 2 years! I started a detailed examination of how a
presumably rational, profit-driven organization such as General Foods
could continue accumulating useless inventory.<p>

CLB: In general, has there been much cross-fertilization between
economics and business and cybernetics?<p>

Strassmann: Yes, to some extent... but much of the writing was just
theoretical, devoid of any experimental testing. I'm too much of an
engineer to tolerate theories that cannot be tested and applied in
practice. My writings and research always end with lists of things to
do.  The intellectual heritage goes back to economists like Friedrich
Hayek and, in fact, goes back more than 200 years ago, when the
debates began whether and how mankind should plan its future, rather
than leave it to some uncontrollable causes. This intellectual
arrogance of presuming that planning can substitute for governance
goes back to the Enlightenment philosophers Diderot and Voltaire in
pre-Revolution France. Impatience with mankind's progress was
transformed into a view that a self-appointed intellectual elite was
sufficiently knowledgeable about what was needed to create a better
future through planning. The basic premise here was that a good
society could be planned and engineered. From these origins sprung
forth two centuries of Socialist movements, in a variety of forms,
including pathological "red" (Communist) and "blackshirt" (Fascist)
varieties... What really fascinated me was the recognition that both
Communism and Nazism were cybernetic run-away designs, because they
abrogated the essence of all cybernetics, which is self-adaptive
feedback controls. They self-destructed...<p>

CLB: You place a tremendous emphasis on the maintenance and increase
of "human intellectual capital" in organizations.<p>

Strassmann: You would not have a microchip, perhaps the most complex
thing mankind has ever put together, without a vast amassing of
information capital. The manufacturing of microchips takes an enormous
accumulation of skills and experiences about the relationships between
matter, electrical characteristics and logical properties. Such
knowledge is not reinvented for each new microchip. Innovation takes
place through integration of added information capital on top of what
has been already gathered. Any new microchip incorporates knowledge
that it "inherited" from chips that were made 15 to 20 years ago.<p>

CLB: Which is why you're also a proponent of object-oriented software
techniques.<p>

Strassmann: That's right. What is just incredible, and only gradually
emerging into human consciousness, is that for the first time the
underlying chemical limitations of the brain to accumulate knowledge
will be overcome by manufacturing experience surrogates--software. The
truly big takeoff in the evolution of mankind's learning capacity is
still ahead of us. In terms of evolution, the tail-end of the 20th
century will be seen as a totally unprecedented turning point in the
relationship between humanity and Nature. Right now we do not have
even a remote clue what that may lead to.<p>

CLB: Right off the biological scale.<p>

Strassmann: It goes right off the scale. The only comparable
development is the dramatic jump that happened at the end of the 19th
century with the advent of locomotion and manufacturing machines.
Although a wide variety of mechanical artifacts have been around for
at least two thousand years (very advanced machines were developed in
Roman times), the capacity of society to integrate them into
productive life remained dormant; the social structures of the various
societies could not take advantage of them. In medieval times, the
guilds successfully opposed machines, as machines threatened their
monopolies based on control over the sources of skilled labor. The
French developed very sophisticated machines, but they were mostly
used to produce amusing toys for the king. In general, the ability to
start accumulating knowledge about machines did not exist. In fact,
the design of machines were always considered a proprietary trade
secret.<p>

What I'm saying is that information technology, or any given
technology, comes into being only when there is a confluence in
evolution and a certain freedom to move to the next plateau -- when a
society is able to use innovation to accumulate knowledge with a
distinct economic advantage.<p>

CLB: <a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/business-value.html">
The Business Value of Computers</a> (1990), advanced your measure
R-O-M (TM), Return-on-Management, as the ideal measure of business
performance. What are your current feelings about this measure?<p>

Strassmann: _The Business Value of Computers_ is an important book,
perhaps my most valuable book in terms of theory. Its focus is on
metrics, how to evaluate the productivity of businesses where
knowledge, not capital, was the source of competitive advantage... In
a few months I plan to publish in _Computerworld_ approximations of
the R-O-M (TM) values (Information Productivity (TM) ratios) for the
FORTUNE 1000 companies.<p>

CLB: In <a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/info-payoff.html">
Information Payoff</a> (1985), you were ahead of your time in
insisting that satisfying customers be the sole focus of a business,
with everything else falling into place around that.<p>

Strassmann: I find that I write about theoretical propositions fairly
early, before they become fashionable. Regarding customer service in
particular, that's derived again from servomechanism theory, what is
called end-loop control... Bureaucracies are dysfunctional because
they respond to their internal contentions rather than customer needs;
the Purchasing Department works against the Engineering Department,
which works against the Production Department...<p>

After the demise of the Soviet Union, the Pentagon has become the
world largest planned economy. I'm now extending the notion of
customer service to the military. When you look today at Bosnia or
Somalia, those are warlord engagements. Local warlords engage in
tactical decisions at the point of the enemy (the "customer"); they
improvise at the point of the engagement, in the field rather than at
a headquarters. The principles of information design and information
feedback are the same, regardless of where and how they are applied.<p>

CLB: We were talking before about the historical desires of elites to
exercise control; can you say a few words about your very public
disagreement with Michael Hammer about reengineering?<p>

Strassmann: Reengineering, like many lofty ideas... has to be examined
by first finding out how it works instead of what it says. One of the
fundamental precepts of reengineering is the idea that you start with
a "blank sheet of paper" to design how an organization is supposed to
function. The reengineers are revolutionaries, who consistently assert
that the past should be discarded and the new must be "reinvented"
from ideas that are not burdened by anything that has come before.
Well, it is demonstrable that it is impossible to restructure an
organization without any trace of what has come before.<p>

All human beings in organizations bring with them their prejudices,
their problems, their inhibitions, etc. After subjecting a group of
workers to violent reengineering, they also have the trauma of being
forcefully dislodged from what they were once doing. You end up with a
disoriented team of people who are not accustomed to work together as
the reengineers prescribe. Even if an organization "annihilates,"
"nukes," or "obliterates" all its people (terms that the reengineers
have used with abandon), you still have to assemble human beings and
find ways for them to willingly cooperate.  The idea that one can
completely design or reengineer organizations by first destroying them
is of utopian and socialist origins, and for the last two hundred
years has been nurtured by radicals seeking a theoretical legitimacy
for seizing power... <p>

Historically, under the cover of assertions that the "reengineers"
are the avant-garde, the contemporary versions of Plato's philosopher
kings, you find calls for the application of organizational violence
as a way of speeding up inevitable progress.  In this respect Michael
Hammer is especially prolific in using metaphors of violence (e.g.
turning guns on your own recalcitrant workers). Such calls to violence
have always resulted in violence, the waging of civil war against
one's own people for their own good. This is something that I have a
very special allergy against.<p>

Reengineering consultants also claim legitimacy for what they propose
by saying "I have here a list of excellent business practices. I'm
going to tell you what the excellent practices are, and if you follow
the list, you'll be okay." The presumption that someone can compile a
universal list of what makes, for instance, for an excellent
information system is misguided. Every firm is different, every
organization has different needs, and therefore every information
system implementation must be unique. This is why awarding the
Baldridge Prize for excellence based on a master checklist is
unjustified. It's based on the idea that a body of experts can
guarantee superior results if you follow their list of excellent
characteristics. That ain't so. So far, 20% of the Baldridge winners
have delivered dismal economic performance.<p>

We are learning now that survival in ecological niches is feasible
through a variety of unique adaptations. There are all kinds of fish
that survive and there are all kinds of worms that prosper. It does
not follow that one species will dominate because they are designed
according to some preordained order or excellence... It does not
follow at all that an organization that connects all employees to the
Internet, uses client/servers, applies object-oriented software, and
incurs heavy expenditures for information technologies will
necessarily be superior to one that conducts modest operations on an
old mainframe computer.<p>

CLB: Instead of "reengineering", you advocate "business process
improvement." How is that different from reengineering, or from Total
Quality Management?<p>

Strassmann: It's very close to Total Quality Management. This
approach, especially as advocated by Juran and Deming, always starts
organically from within the working levels of the organization, bottom
up. You have to harness the imagination of the workers. The person who
works on the assembly line tightening a screw, or the person in the
bookstore talking to the customer, is the crux of all quality.<p>
