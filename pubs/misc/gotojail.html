<i>The title "chief information officer" is pretentious says industry 
pundit Paul Strassmann - at least until CIOs are important enough to be 
sent to jail when they foul up.</i><p>


<font size=+2>I</font><font size=+1>f you think of an executive committee as a family,</font> 
then the head of finance is 
the annoying older brother, who is always telling you 
what to do. The head of IT, on the 
other hand, would be the bratty youngest child.<p>

Often the executive most recently appointed to the committee, they may be seen and 
not heard and expected to heed the wisdom of their elders. Most annoyingly, finance 
may be given the final say in decisions that IT believes it should own.<p>

But according to IT industry pundit Paul Strassmann, this is about to change, with IT 
directors being given an adult place at the table. And if you're tired of finance's 
patronising older brother advice, there is more good news. As the influence of IT 
directors increases, Strassmann predicts, that of finance will decline. <p>

<h3>EVOLUTION OF THE CFO</h3>

According to Strassmann, the head of finance has clout mainly because they have 
"fiduciary" duties. That is, CFOs have legal responsibility to ensure that a company 
cares responsibly for its financial assets and that financial records are correct. If they 
fail in this duty, the CFO can go to jail, often dragging the rest of a company's directors 
with them-enough incentive for boards to value a CFO's advice over that of other 
executives. <p>

However, Strassmann believes that a new form of capital, "knowledge capital", (see 
boxout on p75) is becoming more critical to business than financials. While fiduciary 
duties will always exist, in the future caring for financial assets will be a less critical 
management task than caring for knowledge assets. <p>

So if at present a CFO derives their political power from having the final word on 
financials, in the long-term their influence will be eclipsed by that of the person 
responsible for knowledge, the IT director. <p>

Strassmann admits that this is speculation, and refuses to be drawn on a timeline for 
change, or to explain in detail how the IT director's role will change. <p>

But at the same time, he feels that change is "inevitable". But given the conservatism 
of the financial world in making changes to corporate law, will it ever consider 
knowledge capital an important enough issue to force a rewrite of the rules? <p>

Strassmann feels that even regulatory bodies that would like to ignore the issue will 
one day be forced to pay attention. <p>

"When you look today at the valuations of corporations, you'll find that the knowledge 
capital of most US corporations is worth more than the financial capital. It's now in the 
US$10 trillion range. But if you looked only at traditional financial assets, you could 
buy all America at book value for US$3 trillion. Sooner of later, it will be in the interest 
of taxation authorities and investors, particularly, to ask how well knowledge assets 
are being protected," he says. <p>

However, these US$3 trillion and US$10 trillion figures are Strassmann's own. While 
the financial world agrees in principle that there is value in knowledge, it is still 
arguing about how valuation should be determined. <p>

The first step has been to put current accounting practices under examination in 
countries from the US to Scotland, but the reports being generated are not always 
good news for IT directors. The reason is that a range of non-financial assets being 
considered, many of which are not the responsibility of an IT director. Knowledge is on 
the agenda, but so too are customer goodwill, established brands, partnerships and 
other 'new economy' items. This raises the question: if brands turn out to be as 
critical as knowledge capital to the well-being of a company, does this mean that 
marketing directors should also be handed their own 'fiduciary-style' responsibility 
and greater influence than a CFO - or an IT director? <p>

Regardless, the American Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is cautious 
about ascribing value to non-financial assets. Its April 2001 report, Business and 
Financial Reporting, Challenges for the New Economy, says "commentary, analysis 
and description are vital components of any reporting system, but business ultimately 
demands a form of scorekeeping". <p>

Non-financial assets are hard to quantify and measure consistently between 
companies, the report notes. The trick will be to find a way to "reach beyond those 
traditional metrics and capture information about perceived value drivers in the new 
economy-a company's workforce, customers, and ability to innovate". (A link to this 
report, and to its examination of new metrics under consideration, is available on 
MISweb.) <p>

But regardless of whether standards bodies may be locked in committee for some 
years, there are signs that big corporates are actively considering non-financial 
reporting-a process that could put political pressure on slow-moving regulators. <p>

Companies now include more 'narrative' in their annual reports, says Andersen. This 
is information that companies are not legally required to provide and often includes 
non-financial business metrics that directors feel are relevant in explaining expected 
performance. <p>

According to Andersen's October 2000 survey, Corporate Reporting in the New 
Economy, narrative took up only 45 per cent of the space in the average annual report 
in 1996 but by 2000, this had jumped to 57 per cent.<p>

<h3>HELPING YOURSELF</h3>

If political pressure from business will help the IT directors' case, can IT 
directors themselves also lobby regulators and business to speed up acceptance of 
knowledge capital? <p>

Strassmann himself is a passionate advocate of the topic-in fact, he has been in 
that field so long that he holds the trademark for the phrase 'knowledge capital'. An 
ex-CIO who has run IT for the Pentagon, Xerox and Kraft, Strassmann still consults to 
the US Defence Department and teaches at the US military academy at West Point. <p>

At turns charming when putting his ideas across and impatient when he believes they 
are not understood, he tours the world publicising a need for business to re-think its 
approach to capital and to valuation. <p>

To answer the lobbying question, Strassmann says the IT directors should consider 
how the CFO role changed in the last century. <p>

"Look at the evolution from the bookkeeper to the accountant to the CFO. Did the 
bookkeepers lobby for this? The answer is no. The political authorities, particularly 
when there were large fraudulent situations, said 'You'd better go and find 
somebody'," Strassmann says. <p>

So is the solution for IT directors to make themselves into public scapegoats for 
problems with knowledge? He believes this is almost happening already. <p>

The most obvious type of knowledge negligence, he says, is problems with 
information security. <p>

"Financial capital is hard to steal. Factory buildings cannot be put on a truck," he says. 
"But knowledge capital has the unusual property that it can disappear. Sooner or later, 
it will be in the interest of taxation authorities and investors, particularly, to ask how 
well knowledge assets are being protected." <p>

<h3>INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY</h3>

In fact, Strassmann argues that even today responsibility for information security is 
increasing the influence of IT directors within their companies. For example, a US 
presidential order has forced groups who are vulnerable to information 
warfare-including financial services, government, energy and other vital services-to 
form ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres). <p>

Who attends the meetings? A CIO, says Strassmann, who is then making decisions 
for their entire company. The ISACs are a binding meeting, he explains, "because 
someone has to sign on behalf of the firm that 'We will comply with the following 
precautions'." <p>

This is the type of gradual change in responsibility that IT directors should expect, he 
warns. "CFOs did not get anointed CFOs in 1934 when all this regulatory stuff came 
out. It was a progression. It accelerated. But you can quote me it is going to happen. 
We're questioning how and when." <p>

The most critical change will be the IT department taking on its own fiduciary-style 
responsibilities. <p>

"The CIO is today at the level of evolutionary development that the CFO was 100 years 
ago when the CFO was called a bookkeeper," he says. <p>

"The title of chief information officer is pretentious to say the least, given the level of 
responsibility," Strassmann says. "What I want to put forward as an idea is that for the 
CIO to truly be a CIO he or she must have fiduciary responsibility. In other words they 
have to go to jail if something goes wrong."<p>

<h3>PREPARE FOR CHANGE</h3>

While Strassmann refuses to be drawn on a timeline for the creation of 
fiduciary-style responsibility for CIOs, 
he does offer advice on how to prepare for this change. <p>

<ol>

<li>CORPORATE FINANCE COURSE <p>

"The supreme corporate game is played around the table when the budgets are 
carved. If you are not part of the 
budgeting process, where the trade-offs are made between IT and manpower and 
marketing and research & development and advertising, you're not a CIO. To be able 
to be admitted to that table, you must have the necessary financial understanding."<p>

<li>ACQUIRE AN ALTIMETER <p>

"If you're a pilot and you don't have an altimeter, you're not much of a pilot. So I really 
feel that the CIO must acquire an altimeter. [Currently], the CFO is the custodian of 
return on investment, but that is always the hard stuff. So the CIO must be able to say 
'What is the return on information? For every $1 a company spends on information, 
how much value-add gets created?'" <p>

<li> KNOWLEDGE CAPITAL WORTH <p>

"You'd better know [the worth of your company's] knowledge capital if you want to be in 
charge of knowledge 
capital, protect its security and its integrity, deal with the increasing risks. Information 
crime doesn't have to be overt. It can be from internal corruption or just screw-ups like 
invoices not getting out. <p>

"The exuberant unlimited spending that you saw over the last four or five years? It's 
done. Management is really much more interested now in seeing provable results. <p>

"And so I would say that there's an overwhelming interest in the whole question of 
economic justification. In the US in 2000, 49 per cent of all business investments 
were in IT. If half of all the money that civilisation has available to better itself is spent 
on IT, you'd better have a good explanation for that." <p>

</ol>

describing the benefits of knowledge capital, can be found at

<h3>DEFINING KNOWLEDGE'S VALUE</h3>

What is knowledge capital? Begin by considering the contribution that an 
employee makes to their company's ability to generate revenue-more experienced 
staff are arguably more effective producers, whether they create new ideas in a 
research & development department or goods for customers. <p>

Problems arise, however, when companies want to claim this expertise or knowledge 
as an asset. <p>

First, it is hard to value consistently between companies. A food retailer may consider 
the secret recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken to be valuable knowledge capital where a 
bank with no interest in selling chicken will not. <p>

Second, traditional accounting demands that assets can only be labelled as such if 
they are under the company's control. If staff take their expertise home with them 
when they leave the workplace each night, then it cannot be said to be controlled. <p>

This is where IT directors enter. Strassmann says: "Ultimately, when you look at 
knowledge, it manifests itself through communication and this communication is 
increasingly electronic. You can have a guru sitting in a research laboratory but if the 
phone doesn't work, or the Web doesn't work, or his database has been destroyed 
and his experimental results compromised, you've blown it."<p>
