<blockquote>

<font size="+1">Investments in information technology have no
discernible impact</font> on financial performance, argues consultant,
author and former information technology executive Paul Strassmann.
And yet this disturbing reality has done little to curb I.T. spending,
which has been comparable to anywhere from 40% to 75% of corporate
economic value-added in recent years.<p>

How much longer before the computer industry gravy train derails? <p>

Strassmann argues that the enormous cost of the Year 2000 fiasco -
estimated at $300 billion - will help trigger a backlash against
profligate spending on computers.<p>

Strassmann, who has held top I.T. posts at Xerox Corp., Kraft Foods
Inc. (a unit of Philip Morris Cos.) and the U.S. Department of
Defense, compares computer spending to arms spending. Even though
computers may not boost profits or productivity, corporations keep
spending out of fear their rivals could gain an edge from the latest
tech fad.<p>

"The current corporate and public sector practice is not to budget
computers according to defined results, but according to the perceived
needs of its proponents," writes Strassmann in "<a
href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/squandered.html">The Squandered
Computer</a>," newly published by his own Information Economics Press in
New Canaan, Conn.<p>

<b>IBD:</b> Is there any evidence that investment in information technology
produces superior financial returns?<p>

<b>Strassmann:</b> There is no evidence that investment in information
technology produces superior returns.... I've found that companies
that spend more money on information technology-including a higher
ratio of information technology (costs) to labor costs-don't
necessarily have better financial performance.<p>

<b>IBD:</b> Are corporations too eager to jump on each new generation of
technology?<p>

<b>Strassmann:</b> The bottom line of my book is that management has
largely abdicated the technology acquisition decision to experts and
consultants. They, of course, have a vested interest to jump into
buying more and better and sooner. Consequently, the general tendency
is to buy, and then when it doesn't work you just scrap it and go buy
the next round. The build-and-scrap approach has been endemic for the
last 40 years.<p>

<b>IBD:</b> Should top management be directly involved in technology acquisition? <p>

<b>Strassmann:</b> Absolutely. Management has to start treating
information and databases and software as capital investments that
have a long life. Right now they look at I.T. as an expense. If you
started looking at it as a capital investment, you would look at life
cycle costs, at residual value. You would do all the financial
analysis you do when you buy a building or machine.<p>

<b>IBD:</b> Could companies do more with less I.T. spending?<p>

<b>Strassmann:</b> My position is without question whatsoever that
companies could do much more with less spending.<p>

<b>IBD:</b> It's estimated that it could cost $300 billion or more to
correct the Year 2000 problem. Could this looming expense trigger a
backlash against the spending spree on computers?<p>

<b>Strassmann:</b> That's my prediction. The Year 2000 is one of the
trigger events. The high cost of PC maintenance is another. Morgan
Stanley has just predicted that profits in '98 are going to be down.
The budget-makers are going to look for cuts. They'll say: "Well, who
got the biggest increases in the last eight years? And who are these
people who are causing all these excess costs?"<p>

<b>IBD:</b> And yet corporations are spending big on new Windows NT/software and systems.<p>

<b>Strassmann:</b> Windows NT is very expensive. So now you have this new
network computer idea. The network computer is really the herald of
[companies trying] to slim [I.T.] rations. Certainly, the current
costs of PC ownership are just awful. That number can range anywhere
from $9,000 to $11,000 per seat per year.<p>

<b>IBD:</b> So has anybody actually begun to cut back on I.T.. spending? <p>

<b>Strassmann:</b> Some people are already saying: "We will not increase
your money for Year 2000 so you have to give us savings. It has to
come out of your hide . . . because we are not going to give you money
to fix something that shouldn't have happened to begin with."<p>
