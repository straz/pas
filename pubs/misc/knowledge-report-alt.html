Knowledge Capital</font></b>
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b><font size="+1" color="blue"><p>Knowledge Capital is the value
that a customer assigns on top of
     the cost of sales and cost of capital. It’s the surplus value on
top of the traditional value.
     The people who possess the accumulated knowledge about a company
are the carriers
     of Knowledge Capital. They are the people who leave the workplace 
every night and
     may never return...<br>
  </font></b><br>
  </p>
  <p>Strassmann contends that Information Productivity levels are actually
negative in a
  great many U.S. and international firms he has measured, suggesting that
managers are
  being paid bonuses based on the reported net accounting profit despite
their failure to
  successfully manage and exploit information. &#147;Information is
treated as an instantly
  perishable commodity,&#148; he points out. The deck is clearly stacked
against those who
  would manage knowledge. &#147;In so far as the contributions of people,
information and
  knowledge are concerned, the financial statistics remain silent because
none of these
  contributions to creating greater economic value are recognized in
generally accepted
  accounting principles,&#148; he adds. &#147;The fact is that the annual
costs of
  information have long ago surpassed the costs of equity capital...Except
for some firms,
  such as in steel, mining, transportation and real estate, the scarce
commodity is
  information. It is through effective information management practices
that the users of
  information...create all business value.&#148; KI Editor Britton Manasco
spoke with
  Strassmann recently about the need to effectively measure knowledge and
productivity as
  well as the darkening skies ahead for companies that fail to embrace
this challenge.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p><b>KI:</b> Are there other people engaged in similar efforts in terms
of measuring and
  valuing knowledge assets that you admire and find as good debate
partners?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> Well, as you know, this is a topic that has been
around for a long
  time. I&#146;ve certainly debated this issue with my friends at Ernst
&amp;Young. This
  issue is about 20 years old. Numerous attempts have been made, some
books published.
  Unfortunately, it never went anywhere because nobody could nail anything
down in dollar
  terms. Even the guys from Skandia AFS have fallen short. You cannot take
those numbers and
  do anything with them that would be acceptable as a valuation of assets
on the stock
  market.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> How is your work different from the efforts of others in
this respect?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> What everybody is trying to do is work the problem
of knowledge
  asset valuation from the bottom up. They point to software and patents
and trained people.
  They try and estimate the valuation of that and add it up to come up
with total Knowledge
  Capital. Well, that&#146;s not the way it works. That&#146;s not what
value is all about.
  Value is what the customers' demand values. It&#146;s a top-down issue.
Once you have
  completed the top-down validation, which demonstrates that the market
recognizes the
  value, then you are entitled to look at the details. So, the difference
is, fundamentally,
  between the top-down versus bottom-up approach. I do valuation of
outputs before looking
  at the valuation of inputs. I first examine the capacity of a firm to
receive revenue from
  customers who are willing to pay a premium price because they recognize
that, in addition
  to the capital goods and manufacturing capabilities that you offer, you
offer knowledge.
  Until the customer recognizes that fact, a firm&#146;s Knowledge Capital
is not worth
  anything. My approach is top-down first. Then I do a bottom-up analysis
in a context.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> How far do you think we&#146;ve come in the 20 years that
valuing knowledge
  assets has been discussed and debated?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> Unfortunately, we haven&#146;t come very far.
There is no company --
  with some minor exceptions -- that is willing to put on its annual
report a verifiable
  number that is recognized as Knowledge Capital. People continue to focus
on the
  conventional, deadly stuff: the old, industrial age accounting. When
they are
  &#147;enlightened,&#148; then they add all kinds of fancy prose either
in the letter to
  the shareholders from the president or as an appendix or in speeches.
They say,
  &#147;People are our most valuable assets.&#148; The fact is that when
they report their
  statistics, they are still reporting Return-on-Equity,
Return-on-Investment or
  Return-on-Assets. What they say and what they do does not hang
together.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> Do you find any allies in the accounting profession, or
are they mortal
  enemies?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> The accounting profession is very well set in its
ways. They have
  trouble even doing the traditional auditing of financial assets. They
say that they
  can&#146;t even validate petty cash or account for all of the equipment.
They are not
  interested in accounting for knowledge assets. &#147;We have enough
trouble,&#148; they
  say. &#147;We don&#146;t need more.&#148; They have not paid attention
to Knowledge
  Capital and it&#146;s a problem. If you overpay for an acquisition, the
accountants would
  say, &#147;Let&#146;s write it up as goodwill.&#148; That&#146;s as far
as they have been
  willing to go. Well, it&#146;s not goodwill. It&#146;s what they have
paid for Knowledge
  Capital. The word &#147;goodwill&#148; doesn&#146;t mean a thing.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> Are any of your large clients actively adopting the
approach to valuing
  Knowledge Capital you champion?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> I don&#146;t know. You ask the missionary,
&#147;Will the tribal
  chief adopt Christianity?&#148; The answer is, &#147;Who knows?&#148;
Top management,
  however, is an easy mark for these sort of ideas. They are looking at
stock prices. The
  stock market clearly recognizes Knowledge Capital. Stock market
valuations of equity in
  the United States are over six times financial book assets. How can you
possibly explain
  paying more than six times book value for something? Of course, the CEO
will tell you
  about all the talented people in the organization, which is not a fully
developed
  explanation. The truth is that there is a premium on KnowledgeCapital
that should be added
  to the financial equity value. It turns out that if you take Knowledge
Capital Valuation
  according to Strassmann and then add it to shareholder book equity, you
find that it
  closely tracks the stock market. It is quite obvious that the stock
market is willing to
  recognize Knowledge Capital and pay for it. Why else would you pay 3,000
times earnings
  for a Netscape? Sure, that has come down a bit, but it is still an
extraordinary
  valuation. There is no way to rationalize it unless you recognize that
people are paying
  for Knowledge Capital.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> &#147;The existing methods and concepts of accounting,
budgeting, planning
  are biased against anything that is not a tangible asset,&#148; you
write. What are some
  of the implications of such myopic accounting and planning
processes?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> The consequences, which I have written about for
the last 15 years,
  are that the tangible things get disproportionate attention and the
intangible things sort
  of get sloughed away. Let me give you an example. For years and years,
the big debate
  about computers -- whether it be mainframes or PCs -- was about hardware
costs. Everybody
  has been neglecting the fact that, meanwhile, we have accumulated huge
knowledge assets
  both in training and software. When you suddenly decide to change
hardware because you can
  find a cheaper alternative, you may reduce your hardware costs, but
it&#146;s less and
  less significant.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, you throw out a couple of billion dollars worth of
Knowledge Capital. At the
  Department of Defense, where I started working on these issues, we
realized that the value
  of a heavy armed division is not the tanks that they ride but the people
you have and the
  training they have had -- the Knowledge Capital you have accumulated.
The consequences are
  that if you disregard Knowledge Capital because it doesn&#146;t show up
in the budget you
  are likely to make very poor and costly decisions. I&#146;ve shown in
many of my articles
  that capital is now a small fraction of total input and that information
is now the
  dominant input in the economy by far.</p>
  <p>The question is, How much of that information is expensed and how
much is converted
  into capital? That&#146;s the most significant issue. This really gets
down to some
  fundamental economics. Capital is accumulated labor. That&#146;s how you
justify the price
  for capital. Well, Knowledge Capital is also accumulated labor. The
question then is, Is
  the labor accumulated or is it wasted? If you make a sales call, how
much of that sales
  call is Knowledge Capital and how much is just a sales call expense? So,
this theoretical
  issue of valuation has far reaching implications for lots of things we
do.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> Could you give a definition of Knowledge Capital?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> Knowledge Capital is the value that a customer
assigns on top of the
  cost of sales and cost of capital. It&#146;s the surplus value on top of
the traditional
  value. The people who possess the accumulated knowledge about a company
are the carriers
  of Knowledge Capital. They are the people who leave the workplace every
night and may
  never return. They possess something for which they have spent untold
hours listening and
  talking while delivering nothing of tangible value to paying customers.
Their brains have
  the been the repositories of an accumulation of insights about how
&#147;things work
  here&#148; -- something that is often labeled with the vague expression
&#147;company
  culture.&#148; Their heads carry a share of the company&#146;s Knowledge
Capital, which
  makes them a shareholder of the most important asset a firm owns -- even
though it never
  shows up on any financial reports. Every such shareholder of knowledge
assets in fact
  becomes a manager, because information acquisition and utilization are
the essence of all
  managerial activities.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> You&#146;ve also coined the related terms Management
Value-Added and
  Return-on-Management.</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> Management Value-Added is the engine. It&#146;s
Management
  Value-Added that creates capital. You can have somebody sitting in the
office reading
  manuals and acquiring knowledge. However, itís not worth anything until
management can
  put it to use so that the customer is willing to pay for it. It&#146;s a
computable,
  verifiable ratio. And until you have something repeatable and verifiable
you have nothing.
  That&#146;s why all these efforts to value knowledge, until now, have
been loose. No one
  could repeat the assertions people make. Management Value-Added is what
is left over after
  absolutely all costs are fully accounted for. This calls for subtracting
from the profits
  after tax an allowance for the costs of shareholder equity as well as
other adjustments to
  correct for accounting peculiarities largely influenced by the tax code.
  Return-on-ManagementÔ, an alternative to Return-on-Investment, is a
ratio that accounts
  for both Management Value-Added and the real costs of management.
Knowledge Capital is an
  extension of Return-on-Management and Information Productivity.
It&#146;s a continuum.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> You have pointed out that management often tends to
disregard key issues
  associated with Knowledge Capital when it seeks efficiency. It&#146;s
vital to focus on
  efficiency, but also to develop an asset management perspective, as you
put it.</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> You need both. You have to be efficient.
That&#146;s necessary, but
  not sufficient. In addition to that, you must be accumulating Knowledge
Capital. Anybody
  can cut costs by consuming capital. I can start selling off parts of my
house in what is
  called a reverse mortgage and thereby show income, but I&#146;ll be
consuming capital.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> You think companies typically fail to preserve Knowledge
Capital amidst
  turbulent change.</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> A lot of companies downsize and outsource in order
to increase
  efficiency. That&#146;s okay, but before they do that they must also
consider what impact
  such moves will have on Knowledge Capital. Of course, nobody knows how
to compute
  Knowledge Capital. What they do, invariably, is slim down, reduce costs
and destroy assets
  in the process. Five years later they wonder why the company is in worse
shape than it was
  before.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> What will drive the effort to account for Knowledge
Capital?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> What&#146;s going to happen is the people who
understand knowledge
  assets are going to be the winners. People who manage knowledge assets
as part of their
  strategy are going to win. And people who speak to the old paradigm are
just going to
  lose. They will be using a compass instead of an altimeter. If you mix
up the two you are
  going to crash the airplane.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> You argue that companies can generate and grow Knowledge
Capital by treating
  all overhead expenses -- such as training, meetings, software -- as
potential investments
  in assets with residual value. You measure this by talking about what
you call
  Overhead-to-Asset Conversion Efficiency. Are there some companies that
you would point to
  as being especially progressive in this sense?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> Microsoft is an artist. They have generated more
Knowledge Capital
  than anybody else I&#146;ve seen recently. They do it by not only
appropriating capital
  from their own employees, but they also use the Knowledge Capital of
their customers. In
  1995, it gained $8.3 billion in Knowledge Capital while expending only
$3 billion for
  Sales, General &amp; Administrative (SG&amp;A). To explain
Microsoft&#146;s extraordinary
  Overhead-to-Asset Conversion Efficiency of 277% one has to understand
that Knowledge
  Capital does not need to reside exclusively in the heads of employees.
It also occupies
  the mind-share of customers who have expended their own time and money
to employ Microsoft
  products. The company, for instance, has been able to pass on the costs
of testing new
  software to its customers and learn from them. Microsoft understands the
concept of
  Knowledge Capital very well.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> Where else -- apart from Microsoft -- have you seen
impressive efforts to
  generate and manage Knowledge Capital?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> The pharmaceutical companies understand how to
generate Knowledge
  Capital. For instance, Abbott Laboratories has generated Knowledge
Capital faster than its
  SG&amp;A. It is a highly profitable firm due to the fact that its
Knowledge Capital can be
  reapplied without further expense. They do not have to pay for all of
their current
  SG&amp;A. in every fiscal year. They recycle SG&amp;A at a very low
cost, which saves on
  expenses and increases the value of each employee. But there are other
companies that are
  effectively generating Knowledge Capital. Parts of General Electric
understand it very
  well. Advertising firms understand these concepts. The company that has
created more
  Knowledge Capital than anyone else in terms of absolute value is Coca
Cola. It&#146;s a
  knowledge company. All they sell is water with a little sugar and
bubbles. Itís all
  knowledge of the marketplace, the brand name, advertising, distribution
outlets.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> How will the economy have changed ten years from now as a
result of the
  growing relevance of generating and managing what you call Knowledge
Capital?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> It&#146;s hard to tell and the reason is that the
economy
  doesn&#146;t look good. The number of firms that destroy Knowledge
Capital is greater than
  the number of firms that create Knowledge Capital in the United States.
General Motors is
  actually the largest single destroyer of Knowledge Capital in the U.S.
It destroyed about
  a $150 billion worth of Knowledge Capital. The decline of GM in the
mid-1980's is directly
  traceable to the central controls instituted by the Finance and
Engineering bureaucracies
  over all knowledge. It led to the disabling of the capacity of the
working operators to
  use their capacity to apply their knowledge to improving what they were
doing. If the
  emphasis of a firm is on improving the efficiency of financial capital,
it will
  necessarily lead to the gradual downgrading of the roles of the
operating people.</p>
  <p><b>KI:</b> How do you expect companies to act differently in a
knowledge economy?</p>
  <p><b>STRASSMANN:</b> In a knowledge-based firm, there would be a major
overhaul of the
  present financial planning and budgeting methods to explictly account
for the custody,
  stewardship and growth of Knowledge Capital. In the absence of such a
change in
  performance planning and measurement, firms will continue favoring the
less productive
  uses of financial capital. Indeed, they will fail to capitalize on their
knowledge assets.
