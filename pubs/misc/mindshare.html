      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" > It's not often you meet figures in the IT business who are truly inspirational. 
Oh yes, there are gurus aplenty, and certainly a wide and interesting range of 
opinions. IT managers, in fact, are almost always strategic thinkers with an 
uncanny knack of seeing around corners, figuratively speaking.
<p>
Paul Strassmann, as well as having these qualities, is inspirational. A leading 
exponent of the Economic Value-Added (EVA) model of information productivity, 
Strassmann is a big-picture thinker. His passion for history puts the 
information age in context, and his opinions on the responsibility of the IT 
manager are backed up with the weight of history.
<p>
Strassmann was the keynote speaker at the recent MIS MindShare Annual Retreat, 
where he presented his research into the productivity of information in US 
corporations. His background combines experience in information management with 
strong economic skills. 
<p>
Strassmann began his career in IT management with Xerox Corporation in 1969, 
and was involved in the seminal Palo Alto Research Centre (PARC). He worked 
with Xerox in various information management capacities. It was during this 
time he began his life's work on information productivity and economics. <p>
His focus during this time was on return on management (ROM), developing 
influential indicators on information productivity and knowledge capital.
<p>
Strassmann began publishing books on the subject in the early 1980s, beginning 
with Risk and Technological Innovation, before he left to begin consulting. 
During this time he chaired a White House committee on productivity. His work 
soon attracted the attention of some of America's biggest corporations, 
including General Electric, General Motors, Shell Oil, AT&T and IBM, among 
others, for whom he provided consultancy services.
<p>
Strassmann was also the first director of information at the US Department of 
Defence, where he was in charge of a US$35 billion cost reduction program. He 
left this post in 1993 and since then has been advising governments and 
corporations across the globe, including the Australian Defence Forces.
<p>
<b>Much of your work touches on the contribution that IT can make in terms of 
the general economy and the wealth of a nation. How did you come to the view 
that IT could contribute to society in such a way?</b>
<p>
Well, much of this is to do with the philosophy of how societies advance and 
dealing with the fundamental issue of historical forces. Mankind has a long 
history of probing to advance itself and to create liberty for people, and the 
ability to live in freedom.
<p>
My hobby is really the history of the world. In fact, I did the museum for 
Xerox's world headquarters on the history of communications covering 10,000 
years. What I've come to recognise is that the evolution of a broad historical 
trend has always been based on mankind being able to capitalise on skills. 
<p>
Whether that means chipping a stone, so that it then becomes a piece of 
capital, or whether it comes from an irrigation system, a steam engine and so 
forth, the progression of mankind has always been associated with mankind's 
tools. In fact according to some philosophical views, man is a tool-making 
animal. And you always see that there is a limitation of growth.
<p>
But you can only extract so much productivity out of raw materials and machine 
tools. And after a while you end up having as many refrigerators as possible. I 
became fascinated about 30 years ago with the whole notion of what is the next 
wave of mankind. In the last 50 years most of the developed countries have 
pretty much caught up with America in terms of income per capita. Everyone 
seems to stagnate at about $40,000 to $50,000 per capita.
<p>
I started looking at what limitations mankind has to overcome. And what 
basically happened was that as we started really developing a capability of 
almost unlimited supply of goods, the discounter that started kicking in was 
the overhead, or what I call social coordination costs. Starting in 1976, when 
I was able to look at the global Xerox Corporation, and I was able to look at 
89 countries, I had total data about what copying equipment they sold, how many 
employees they had and so on ... total information. 
<p>
I started to become very much concerned about the future of Xerox. Because it 
became quite obvious that Xerox, in terms of manufacturing these machines that 
spewed out more paper, was coming to a limit. 
<p>
And this is where I started. In the early 1970s some of us started developing 
the concepts, which in those days we called the office of the future, but my 
writing rejected those terms. We started really looking at information-based 
society.
<p>
I started looking at the cost of coordination. What came out of this work was 
that if we don't solve the problem of coordination cost, then what are the 
economies that we get out of materials? They are going to be choked by the 
increased complexity and the increased cost of so-called middlemen.
<p>
In order to achieve the global distribution and optimisation of materials they 
have to start looking at a global society, global connectivity. Middlemen and 
warehouses and the like were just not going to work. And so I basically 
postulated in my first book that most developed countries can overcome the 
limitation of $40,000 to $50,000 in real income per capita and move to what may 
be perhaps as much as $250,000 real income per capita, in a fairly rapid way. 
[To do that] we have to try and find a way to overcome what is called market 
transfer costs.
<p>
<b>You're talking about creating wealth in a society?</b>
<p>
I'm talking about society, but wealth is created in corporations. Corporations 
are the engine of wealth creation. If you want to solve the societal problems, 
you have to look at the engines of wealth creation.
<p>
<b>In terms of the individual CIO, how does he or she look past the 
day-to-day?</b>
<p>
Well, are you cutting stones and building a wall, or building a cathedral? What 
I am beseeching these people to do - because they are enjoying a privileged 
position - is to start realising that if all they're doing is putting together 
rock piles, particularly brittle rock piles, then they're just going to invite 
doubt.
<p>
<b>You mentioned in your keynote the danger of having generalists moving into 
the IT role.</b>
<p>
Yeah, and the reason is again lessons from history. Competence is very 
important. If you want to build a civilisation based on information, then you 
must have people who really understand the dynamics and the risks. These MBA 
wonders, who sort of get flushed in and out as sort of custodians, are 
dangerous.
<p>
Let me tell you the story about the demise of the Spanish Empire, which used to 
be the most powerful empire in the world because they had all the gold. The 
fundamental flaw that the Spanish Empire made was that you could only hold a 
position as a general or as a captain of a warship if you came from a noble 
family. The Brits just took any pirate who knew how to run a ship. And guess 
who won the game?
<p>
<b>The Brits?</b>
<p>
The Brits. Without the gold, without anything except eking out a living.
<p>
<b>So it was an economic victory as well as a social one?</b>
<p>
That's right. So these grandees who enter parliament ... they just believe the 
latest buzzwords they read in the newspapers. You can't run things that way. I 
mean if you want to run a warship, you have to be a competent navigator. And 
your crew has to trust you in a storm. So that's my comment on MBAs running big 
computer operations.
<p>
And so the danger of IT managers becoming negligent in their duties is to the 
corporation and to society in general?
And you know, it happens many times in history, and I can give you many 
examples of destruction of very prosperous societies, the collapse of the 
French Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Portuguese Empire. Ultimately all can be 
traced to the leadership of the politically correct.
<p>
There are certain things that have to be done professionally. Technology alone 
isn't good enough. But if you want to build something and provide true 
captains, then you must combine both the skill of navigation, the skill of 
command, the skill of knowing whether you have enough rations for the crew.
<p>
The other notable thing that I've picked up on during our conversations is that 
there is a strong warlike element to your conversations.
<p>
You're dealing with commercial warfare. The world as I see it at this juncture 
- and this is a very favourable development - has economic competition, which 
is a form of warfare. I don't like other warfare - Kosovo is a deplorable 
situation. Warfare is the proper way to deal with modeling what's going on. And 
much of the reason why people are technology-promiscuous is that it is an arms 
race. An arms race is OK, but then you also have to invest in the generalship, 
the ability to lead. 
<p>
Ultimately, when everyone has the same weapons, it's the best troops and the 
best generals who win. And in fact having weapons alone will not win you the 
war, like we have proven in Vietnam.
<p>
The timespan in business today for competitive advantage is becoming much 
shorter.
<p>
It's becoming shorter, but this is why this phenomenon of Amazon.com is a 
dramatic phenomenon. This is about disintermediating coordination costs. This 
is the economic label for it.
<p>
<b>Yes, I love that word, &quot;disintermediation.&quot;</b><p>
It's an armed attack on the whole establishment. You see it on brokerages and 
financial industries, all of these vestiges of entrenched, monopolised or 
quasi-monopolised transaction costs are just crumbling.
<p>
<b>So in terms of this new economy, and the changing rules of engagement for 
business warfare, how does the IT manager of the future become a good general, 
and how do his troops become good troops?</b>
<p>
Well you become part of the spear, the edge of the spear. The shaft is still 
provided by business, but the front edge of the spear and the aim must be 
perfect. It must be well-timed, economical, aggressive, reliable and most 
provide a protection against risk. If you trust a Spanish warship loaded with 
gold to a flunkey son of a Spanish grandee, well he's just going to get picked 
apart by the British pirates. You see, Betty Number One [Strassmann refers here 
to Queen Elizabeth the First] was basically a venture capitalist.
<p>
<b>This is not a role many IT directors would see themselves as, a spearhead I 
mean.</b>
<p>
It's almost comparable with what happened in England and Scotland in the 
mid-19th century where people like James Watt figured out steam engines. Steam 
engines had been around since the 1500s, but no one knew how to harness it into 
an environment.
<p>
For a technology to come through a number of political and economic conditions 
must be present to create this chain reaction. We are clearly at a point in 
history not equaled since the Rennaissance, and the Western World took off in 
the Rennaissance.
<p>
The Rennaissance took off and created the merchant class, and [saw] the 
breaking of the power of the church and the breaking of the power of the 
aristocracy. What I'm saying is that we are now at the threshold of a period - 
which may or may not come soon - where the power of the entrenched bureaucratic 
monopolies is weakened. Industrialisation has created wealth - the lawyers, the 
customs agents and the brokers. The information workers in the US now receive 
64 per cent of all wages and salaries.
<p>
In the same way that the rise of the merchant class destroyed the power of the 
church and the landed classes, who is going to be the loser in this revolution?
<p>
In those days power lay with those who had land, which was the primary source 
of wealth, and the church sort of legitimised it. But in the same way as land 
as a primary asset was broken, we are now seeing the breakdown of financial 
capital as a primary asset. The dominant asset around which all the information 
warfare will revolve for, say, the next 100 years will be knowledge assets, 
prime assets that give you competitive advantage. In many ways this is a more 
precarious revolution because the risks are greater.
<p>
<b>There is a strong element of responsibility on the IT manager here.</b>
<p>
I take the theological view that people are responsible. With freedom comes 
responsibility. In my view, there are only two commandments, one is man shall 
be free, the other is that man shall be accountable. And so privilege is really 
a form of freedom, but with that goes accountability, because if you don't have 
that the freedom will be taken away.
<p>
I think there is a frustration out there with IT managers because people don't 
really understand what they do, and the contribution they make. I think it's 
good for IT managers to place what they do in some kind of context, that there 
is a great significance in what they do.
<p>
<b>But few people get into IT for any altruistic reasons.</b>
<p>
When you look at the history of ideas there are lots of reasons why people 
became Christians, and not necessarily financial reasons. As a human being life 
is brutal and short, you come and go. And so you have to provide some kind of 
hope beyond your own existence, otherwise you are just like a slug.
<p>
So the legitimacy of the privileged class, the intelligentsia and 
well-compensated people comes back to my second commandment [man must be 
accountable]. You must understand that until recently mankind really struggled 
for survival and financial well-being unless you were born into the right 
family. And so now that you have the position of privilege, for heaven's sake, 
don't give it away.
<p>
You must also be careful to make a distinction between technology and 
information and knowledge. What is at stake here is not the plumbing. This is 
where the thing gets lost. You call these people CIOs - it's nonsense, they're 
not CIOs. They are computer junkies. They are stone cutters. Now you will 
always need stone cutters, but the possibilities to take whole nations up the 
next slope, is up to a different class of people.
I actually really believe it may well come out of the Pacific region. <p>
The Chinese and Japanese cultures are going through a tremendous shock. In 
fact, because of the enormous human capital, they may turn out to be better off 
having gone through those tribulations. It takes 40 years in the wilderness 
sometimes to make a nation.
<p>
<b>Once again, to bring this back to the day-today level of the IT manger, what 
does he need to do?</b>
<p>
He has to become very good. He needs to survive. He really has to become the 
person that deals with information as a commodity, rather than as a privilege 
or a concession. Ultimately, information needs become a commodity. It has to be 
democratised, it has to be in a marketplace.
<p>
Every human being within 50 years is going to own hundreds of microprocessors. 
Chips in everything. They will have the ability to steer the process in the 
same way as the people who started managing steam engines and then electrical 
motors.
<p>
In my house today I may have hundreds of electrical motors. Actually, last time 
I counted it was 60. They are in places you wouldn't even expect. People never 
give enough thought to the amount of electrical motors they have in their 
houses. The beauty of the chips is that they are actually capable of populating 
everything, including your milk carton and the contents of your refrigerator. 
But if you would have told my grandfather that his grandson would own 100 
electrical motors, he wouldn't have believed it. Yet the engineering of that 
transition - making it possible for the enterprise to convert all of this into 
economic value - is really the task of the IT manager [when chips are 
pervasive].
<p>
It is the ability of the IT manager who isn't just the technology pusher, the 
architects of information, not the plumbers, is the role of the IT executive in 
the 21st century. The architect designs, looks at the economics. They need to 
hire in contractors, the plumbers, the excavators and so on. But you build a 
cathedral.
<p>
This whole notion that the IT executive becomes an architect that can match the 
needs of society, the customer, can deal with competition, and really show the 
corporation how it can integrate information and knowledge into its economic 
engine, is really the task. And if they don't lift themselves, they will just 
remain the plumbers, the service workers.
