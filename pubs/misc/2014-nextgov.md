#### Time to leave the COBOL-based application behind

The Defense Department has decided to retire its 19-year-old retiree
pay system written in “antiquated” computer code and replace it with a
lower cost, easier to use application based on off-the-shelf
technology.

The Defense Retiree and Annuitant Pay System, or DRAS, maintains
military pay accounts for more than 2.6 million military retirees,
former spouses and survivor beneficiaries totaling $40 billion a
year. The system was introduced in 1995 and is based on [Common
Business Oriented Language](http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/cobol/cobol.html) computer code of the time.

DRAS uses “antiquated mainframe technology dating back to 1980 that
has exceeded the end of its planned lifecycle,” the Defense Logistics
Agency said in a [request for proposals](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&tab=core&id=b9e11363cedb3fa413b883693c46b957&_cview=0) released last week for a new
DRAS2 to go to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service.

The current, aging DRAS, the solicitation said, has 40 internal
interfaces between subcomponents for data file transfers, and over 220
external interfaces “resulting in a system that is difficult and
costly to maintain and modify and is highly susceptible to errors and
rework.”

The old pay system only offers limited automated data validation
checks, does not conform to the current Defense data standard taxonomy
and does not have a common data environment (master data
model). Further, the data elements are not compliant with Standard
Financial Information Systems requirements, DLA said, [explaining](https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=dd2f695329068e2466d269b170598227) the need for a new system.

DLA seeks a vendor versed in the seven-stage [Business Capability
Lifecycle](https://dap.dau.mil/glossary/Pages/3010.aspx) for
planning, design, acquisition, deployment, operations,
maintenance and modernization of Defense Business Systems.

The RFP calls for the winning vendor to develop new system
architecture, a functional and technical design, convert and manage
data migration from the old to new systems, develop new data
interfaces, and provide a software development methodology, among
other tasks. Interested vendors must reply to the RFP by June 4.

**Paul Strassmann**, an information technology consultant who served as
director of Defense Information from 1991 to 1993, doubted the
department’s timing and priorities with the DRAS2 contract. “DoD
should not replace retiree systems until it can be integrated with the
employee personnel database,” he said. “There are too many duplicate
databases involved in human resources. The savings are in overhead
costs, not in the operating costs on hardware.”

Strassmann added, “With [computer] security spending 19.3 percent of
its 2015 funding, and a 6 percent cut in the IT budget, there is no
money available to replace a legacy system. DLA should be allocating
scarce funds to improve the security of the legacy retiree pay system,
which is likely to be vulnerable to hacking and corruption, before
spending money on anything else.”
