<tr><td>
<font size="+2">T</font>he introduction of a competitive marketplace has,
in due course, led to the uprooting  of monopolies,
the destruction of the privileges
of established organizations and the obliteration of
economic inefficiencies.  When Knowledge Capital
is delivered as a knowledge support service
via a competitive marketplace, the existing
strongholds of knowledge monopoly, of office-holder privileges
and of wasteful information handling will be endangered.<p>

Feudalism, as a form of land ownership,
prevailed until land became a
readily marketable commodity.
Industrial production, in the form of
protectionist mercantilism or national industrial
policy still prevails, but is in the process
of being swept away by globalization of
free trade and by the lowering of transaction
costs through electronic commerce.<p>

At this stage of USA development
over 67% of all wages and salaries are for
information work.  I estimate that at least
a half of that pays for people whose jobs
are unaffected by a competitive
marketplace.  This includes just about all
corporate bureaucracies (consuming about
one third of the total cost of goods sold),
just about all government plus a vastly wasteful
support infrastructure such as in health
services, law and education.<p>

The most plausible forecast of what
is likely to happen can now be based
on what occurred in the past:  when the
accumulation of inefficiencies becomes unaffordable
innovative institutions will deliver the means for
creative destruction of whatever is not
viable.<p>

The future of the new era based on
competitive marketing of Knowledge Capital services
is emerging.  Over the next decade we will
see a transformation from fixed overhead costs -
set by fiat - to competitively priced variable services
- with values set by the marketplace.<p>

That change will be at least as painful as what
has happened in the past when monopolies had
to yield to competitive encroachments.  As we keep marveling about
the harnessing of information technologies
in the service of knowledge management we must be reminded
that all revolutionary changes have been always countered
by counter-revolutionary
reactions.<p>

The destination of knowledge services is clear, but how
long it will take to get there is still a guess and gamble.
