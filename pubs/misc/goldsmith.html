Politics of Information Management</a></h2>
<b>by Neal M. Goldsmith<br><br>
Business Technology</b><br>
Volume 2, February 1995<hr>


We've all seen a lot of Paul Strassmann in the trade press lately [see also,
Interview, page 6 of this issue]. We've seen his careful cost equations and
cogent sociology-of-business
analyses. But do we really need another more than 500-page systems management 
tome [<a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/iep.html">Information 
Economics Press</a>, 1995], especially one
that weighs in at two pounds, six ounces and features a detailed, nine-page
table of contents with sub-sub-sublistings?<p>

Yes, we do - very much.<p>
Strassmann has the background it takes. His career includes service as chief
information officer at General Foods, Kraft Corporation, Xerox, and more
recently, the Department of Defense (he was awarded the Defense Medal for
Distinguished Public Service, the Defense Department's highest civilian award,
for his reengineering of the defense information infrastructure). Importantly
for the present work, Strassmann also served a stint as vice president of
strategic planning for the Information Products (office automation) Group at
Xerox Corporation.<p>

In a logical and straightforward manner bordering on the blunt, Strassmann
makes his basic point -
that "computerization has become the primary means for overhead reduction which
results in diminished power for a large segment of the corporate bureaucracy."
As such, the role of IS executive will have little to do with technology and
everything to do with governance.<p>

That's "governance" rather than politics in the usual sense of the word.
"Managing information systems" Strassmann contends, "is primarily a matter of
politics and only secondarily a matter of technology." Strassmann's "politics"
has more in common with the Founding Fathers in Philadelphia than it does with
mundane office intrigue. In fact, Strassmann's book recommends that
corporations explicitly follow the model of the U.S. federal system, self-consciously
negotiating the rules by which we will govern and regulate our access to and
communication of information. That is, convene a company-wide
"constitutional convention," establish a separation of powers amount IS, senior
executives, departments and end users, and delineate "states" (departmental)
rights. To support this perspective, we are treated first to an overview of the
definitions and operation of governance, in the corporate context. This section
provides an understanding of the basics; policy, information management,
delegation, leadership, conflict resolution; and, relatedly, federation and the
U.S. constitutional model. These are the issues of governance, be it of a
company or a country. Next, Strassmann drops down from the 50,000-foot
level to provide us with some grounding in real-world
cases chosen from his broad experience. Drawing analogies to the cold war and
the history of the World, the book clearly elucidates the cultural battle lines
over which we have all struggled, providing a broader context for understanding
and action in the corporate arena. He states,<p>
<p>
<i>"In many respects, the insertion of computers into the industrial-age
organization is analogous to the introduction of firearms into the feudal
fiefdoms. Cannons, once seen as a means fro strengthening the power of feudal
sovereigns, turned out to be the means for accelerating their demise."</i><p>
<p>
Of particular interest is Strassmann's chapter on reengineering (although, in
reality, the entire book orbits, at times only implicitly, around the mass of
reengineering that currently dominates business systems applications). He
deftly and logically takes us through the historical and philosophical
antecedents of contemporary reengineering practice. The chapter distinguishes
what Strassmann sees as the self-destructive,
dictatorial nature of the "Hammer" school of reengineering, from the true
character of healthy, revolutionary change (as modeled by late eighteenth
century political events in the U.S. and France).<p>
Strassmann arrays the standard Hammer quotes in all their horrific efficiency:
"On this journey we . . . shoot the dissenters;" ". . . the way you deal with
resistance is . . . a bloody ax;" "What you do with the existing structure is
nuke it!" "The last thing that reengineering does is to enhance the manager's
sense of importance. Managing isn't important." Despite the cruel logic of the
numbers -
human resources are the most costly and least effective variable in the
equation of business Strassmann makes a persuasive business case for the
importance of morality, ethics and loyalty in fostering long-term success.<p>
The next section of the book returns to the level of structure and definitions;
this time not about corporate governance, but about individual leadership.
Strassmann provides us with a context for the role and objectives of the CIO,
emphasizing clear cost-reduction
deliverables and railing against the distorted elevation of the image of the
CIO. Strassmann's believes that the CIO has been seduced by the public
relations hyperbole that has been created, in most cases by consultants eager
to reshuffle management structures for hefty fees. He feels that the primary
role of the CIO is to manage a strategic resource, not to reengineer the
departments of corporate peers. In fact, the job of CIO, according to
Strassmann, is really that of executive politician (in Strassmann's high-
minded definition of the term) building support-
and succeeding by fulfilling the needs of the organization, not by enforcing a
rigid set of standards and procedures.<p>

Having defined and explored leadership, Strassmann again grounds his logic with
perhaps the largest of real world cases -
the U.S. Department of Defense. As Director of Defense Information he presided
over CIM (corporate information management), a massive, department-wide 
plan to migrate to standard (non-proprietary)
systems and completely overhaul the software engineering and database
development processes.<p>

Of course, the story of the politics behind the CIM project is the true lesson
here. Strassmann sharply draws the enthusiastic creativity at the start of the
project as well as the petty frustrations and politically motivated budget cuts
that resulted in a new systems infrastructure that was much smaller than
originally planned and which eventually devolved mainly to a "policy of
drastically cutting inefficient operating expenses." Strassmann pulls no
punches. He is totally unconcerned about pointing to his own proposals for
taming the bureaucracy -
or to the shortsightedness of those who did not accept his advice. Strange
thing, though no one has ever challenged the $26 billion savings (over seven
years) that won him his medal. Strassmann's analysis is clear and unemotional
and, as such we feel confident that his lessons will be relevant, not just self-serving 
spin control. In the final part of this sweeping work, Strassmann takes on the
barriers to a healthy, logical corporate politics: fear of politics, putting
technology before politics, and a variety of maladaptive corporate governance
models, such as technocratic utopianism ("no details; no costs; just
generalities"), anarchy ("everyone for themselves"), monarchy ("pay allegiance
to the dictator") and feudalism ("business unit computing autonomy") are all
exposed as ineffective or worse. Finally, Strassmann presents his concept of
corporate "federalism." Similar to our own balance of power between state and
national governments, federalism in the corporate context fits our
decentralized corporate structures and distributed information systems
perfectly. Corporate federalism requires a great deal of trust and cooperation
among co-workers
- not exactly the conditions we find in contemporary business. Toward the end of
the book, Strassmann explains:<p>
<p>
<i>"My opposition to the more radical and drastic forms of reengineering comes
from a recognition that even though wholesale dismissals may deliver short term
economic gains, the intrusion of fear and dictatorial practices will tear apart
the social bonds among people that are prerequisite for cooperation based on
negotiated compromise. Organizations that aspire to federated forms of
management must sustain mutual trust."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
This is an aggressive and intelligent treatment of a huge subject. Strassmann
provides us with both the structure and the functioning of the way we organize
to administer information. (Strassmann even provides us with a hilarious, tongue-in-cheek 
glossary, e.g., "Business Reengineering: A process to involve employees in
recommending how to dispense with themselves" or "Macintosh: Name of a fruit,
copied by a computer company that copied a computer design from a company that
made good copies but could not sell originals.") Defining the corporate
information function in the broadest historical, political, philosophical and
management context, and providing significant - and personally experienced -
case examples, all in one volume, is quite  an accomplishment. To also find it
readable, amusing and so eminently clearheaded is a rare find indeed. <p>
