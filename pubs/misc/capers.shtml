<font size="+4">A</font><font size="+2">n acute awareness of the
potential severity</font> of the year 2000 problem has now surfaced on
the agenda of every executive responsible for information management.
This includes not only CIOs and computer operations managers, but also
boards of directors, audit committees, and computer steering
committees. Such consciousness is only of a recent origin. Judging
from articles in the press, professional papers, and technical
meetings, the year 2000 has become a topic worthy of focused
discussion only in the last two years. Such a recent awakening of
threats to the operational and financial health of organizations may
be puzzling, especially in retrospect. The delays in dealing with what
are now likely widespread damages will surely be argued when
litigation suits base their compensatory claims as incontrovertible
proof of managerial negligence.<p>

The coming of a new century has been predictable for at least a
thousand years. Why then the delays, surprises, and the rapidly
escalating panic that a year 2000 debacle may not only jeopardize the
financial health of a firm, but also destroy careers and reputations?<p>

I find that the principal reason for the current confusion and dismay
has been the absence of a thoughtful and well documented analysis of
the severity of the problem. The early warnings about the incipient
year 2000 problems were dismissed with incredulity. They lacked
sufficient and substantive documentation about the amount and quality
of the work that had to be accomplished. Even headline-grabbing
research service pronouncements were greeted with skepticism because
they could not explain how they arrived at their estimated
expenditures to fix the problem. Individual organizations had no way
of coming up with a budget that would assure their management that any
proposed spending was based on demonstrable and sound cost-estimating
principles. Multiplying the inventory of lines of code under control
of the CIO - if such an inventory was available at all - by one of the
wide-ranging cost quotes per line of code yielded numbers that very
few financial executives could accept for redirecting funds.<p>

This book stands out as the best, most thorough, and monumental
contribution in defining what the year 2000 problem is all about. In
painstaking detail it describes what is the scope of the year 2000
problem and what are the most likely approaches that could lead to
alleviating its damage. It documents the dimensions of the software
defects, organizational problems in managing year 2000 projects, and
resource limitations in much greater detail than anything that has
been published so far by anyone. For that reason, it should receive
immediate acceptance as a much sought-after reference for anyone who
wishes to check the adequacy of their year 2000 protective measures.<p>

This book is required reading for all executives who may have to
account for their custodianship of the year 2000 solutions whenever
the inevitable after-the-fact recriminations occur. In the same way as
the fall of the Berlin Wall became the symbolic event marking the
downfall of a mismanaged Soviet Empire, it is likely that the enormous
costs, litigation, and adverse publicity of any year 2000 failures
will be seen as the end of trust in the management of information
technologies. What will follow are inevitable changes in organization
budgeting, and accountability. There is still a preciously small
amount of time to get a grip on dealing with the year 2000 challenges,
but that must be done with the aid of rational and comprehensive
analysis. I trust that this new book by Capers Jones will provide
those insights and guidance.<p>
