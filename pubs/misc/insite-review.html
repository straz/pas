<h3>The Proof of the Pudding</h3>

<blockquote>
In our future, as technology advances, so will the demand to access massive
amounts of relevant information. Furthermore, as markets change, companies and
organizations will run into global competitors that increasingly look to
information and information technology for competitive advantage.<br>
-- Gary Cokins
</blockquote>

Cockins' quote is the context within which Paul Strassmann has been asking some
very penetrating questions about information management. There are many ways to
word these questions, but this is their gist: 

<ul>
<li> Do businesses manage their information effectively? 
<li> Do businesses experience gains from their IT investments? 
<li> Can businesses measure the productivity of the information they use? 
<li> Can the business costs of computers and information services be
justified? 
</ul>

Rather than just idly speculating, Strassmann actually researches these
questions while conducting his consulting work. Since his reputation gives his
access to some of the biggest and most notable corporate clients in the United
States, he is able to directly gather the representative indicators to begin
answering his questions. He then personally manages the analysis of that
corporate data, thereby being able to both attest to the reliability of the
analytical technquies AND the veracity of the results.<p>

Strassmann's first report on the current phase of his research was his previous
book THE SQUANDERED COMPUTER. Just the title gives a pretty good idea of what
his message is! In this newest book, Strassmann extends his analysis to show
how precariously balanced is the computerization justification. The answers to
his four questions are: No, No, No, and No. The problem is, that activity-based
cost management has NOT been used to guide or evaluate spending on information
management. Instead IM/IT is expensed as an overhead cost. This disguises the
fact that in many cases, information management is a cost centre rather than a
source of value-added. AND since information management costs are now generally
more important than capital costs, the mis-management and waste in this area is
appalling. <p>

INFORMATION PRODUCTIVITY is a very important book because it both diagnoses the
problem AND provides a prescription for better results. Currently popular
accounting methods CANNOT deal with the economic role of information. Economic
value-added cost-activity management can both demonstrate the contribution of
information management AND provide the basis for improving performance.  <p>

Strassmann's analysis suggests that most of the recent gains in productivity
have come from effective macro-economic management of national interest rates
by Alan Greenspan rather than from bloated software from the likes of Bill
Gates. The recent Microsoft decision to focus on networked computing rather
than the desktop as the frontier of IT, is telling in this regard. Any general
improvement in information productivity will require both proper accounting AND
more effective technology. A combination of Strassmann's Information
Productivity&reg; methodology for the purposes of relative ranking and benchmarking
comparisons, and Gates' Office 2000 Application Suite and Windows 2000
Operating System for better integrated performance, could be the start of
value-adding IM and IT. And the priority has to be Strassmann's methodology --
because only with an understanding of the productivity problem and a plan to
improve it, is there a basis for building a business case for effective IT
acquisition and information management.
