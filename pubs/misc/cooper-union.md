Two days after landing in New York on October 15, 1948 I went to a
Jewish charitable agency, HIAS (Hebrew Immigrants Aid Society), to ask
for help how I could get an engineering education.  A kind and an
amazingly patient lady pointed out to me that such an education was
very hard to get because it required qualifications that I simply did
not have which included no money for tuition.

Furthermore, engineering was not at all a recommended profession for
Jews in 1948.  Jews achieved prominence in other occupations, such as
in finance, business and trading.  It would be unlikely if I could get
admission to any university or college without additional credentials,
such as a high school diploma.  In essence, the HIAS advisor confirmed
what I had been already told by the Kubiceks.

I was devastated by such news, but that did not stop me insisting that
only an engineering education would be an acceptable choice.  The HIAS
lady then mentioned that there was an excellent engineering school in
New York, the City College that was tuition free except that
applicants who were war veterans with admission priority besieged it.
The veteran's administration also paid their fees.  At this point I
was confused how a tuition-free college could have fees.  Oh, the lady
said, those were laboratory fees.  In addition the costs for books and
supplies could amount to as much as $150 per semester.  I was crushed.
In my refugee mindset there was no way how I could see my way of
obtaining what appeared to me such a great sum of money.

I must digress now to explain why I was vehemently fixed on
engineering as a career and would not consider anything else.  Based
on what I have experienced since 1938 I became convinced that the only
property worth having was a skill that could be ported anywhere in the
world without even carrying a suitcase.  That eliminated for me
anything that would be in any way connected with a business,
especially after witnessing how my father became tied down to property
as an inhibition to fleeing Slovakia.  Although my hidden ambitions to
seek justice had me dreaming about becoming a judge that was
completely out of the question in America where I was an immigrant
stranger.

Medicine did not appeal to me after I saw too many dying people who
could not be helped.  Engineering satisfied a deeply held emotional
appeal.  It offered a sense of calculating certainty about the tools
that supported our civilization as well as independently verifiable
evidence whether something that was created was working or not.

The refugees I have met &mdash; and these were people associated with the
Kubiceks &mdash; talked about making big profits from trade.  They were
alienated from America and kept talking about the way things were in
Europe.  All I was interested in was earning modest wages that would
afford a living that would guarantee, as a minimum, an unlimited
supply of baked potatoes and a warm bed where I could sleep in peace.
More than anything else, I wanted to become an American after I
witnessed the generosity, uninhibited behavior and lack of prejudice
against me from all of the Americans I had a chance to meet.  Clearly,
working as an American engineer would be a way to heaven on earth.

Meanwhile, back at HIAS, the lady could not comprehend why I kept
insisting on engineering as a career.  Out of compassion for my
hard-headed perseverance or perhaps to get rid of me I was advised
that there was a school for indigent New Yorkers just around the
corner from HIAS, then located on Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan.
That school had been accepting exceptionally talented but needy
students.

Subsequently, I found out that the highly rated Cooper Union for the
Advancement of Science and Art was the only engineering college in the
United States that had no tuition because it was completely endowed by
a good real estate investments.  The student body was very small,
admitting only one hundred engineering students each year.

I walked a few blocks north to an ancient looking red sandstone
edifice and located the admissions office of the school.  There I met
Walter Watson, Director of Admissions and Registrar, and obviously the
gatekeeper to Cooper.  Mr. Watson showed much patience and listened
with attention to my story.  There was little he could do for someone
speaking bad English, without a high school diploma and who did not
even know what was a SAT test.  Years later I found out that Watson
engaged in research on the predictive attributes of SAT on academic
success.  His problem was that Cooper, known as most demanding school
to get into, had looked only at SAT scores of the best students from
New York elite schools, such the Bronx High School of Science and
Brooklyn Tech.  I suspect that, as a good statistician, Watson needed
for his sample what appeared to be a bright but totally unprepared
SAT-taker.

Watson suggested that I sit for an SAT examination so that I could
submit an application for admission in the fall of 1949.  Since I
could not afford the $60 SAT fee &mdash; I was so poor that I was wearing a
hand-me-down coat and jacket &mdash; he offered to pay for it.  Meanwhile, I
should hurry up and get a high school diploma.  I accomplished that by
enrolling for night classes at Jamaica High School so that I could
qualify for what was then known as New York State Regents tests in
English, American History and mathematics.

I plunged into the required reading materials and attended classes
every evening until 10PM. Qualifying for a High School diploma turned
out to be easy &mdash; the classes were filled with kids who had flunked
regular High School classes and were now using the night school as a
way of cramming for an exam that was particularly forgiving to
disadvantaged candidates.  I received my American high school diploma
in May of 1949.


I barely passed the SAT in the spring.  I also ranked at the bottom
among the list of applicants for Cooper.  Despite a failing grade in
verbal skills I got an almost perfect score for logical reasoning,
such as answering a question what shape looked like another when
rotated in three-dimensional drawings.


For some peculiar reason there is one incident that I remember clearly
from my first trip to New York on the way to HIAS.  I stopped at Horn
& Hardart.  At that time it was a favorite cafeteria &mdash; the restaurant
offered food from coin-actuated compartments. I bought a cup of hot
cocoa for 15 cents.  At each table there were glass jars with salt,
pepper and sugar.  As I kept adding sugar to my cocoa an old lady
remarked that there must be something wrong with me if I kept adding
more sugar to my cup as I was drinking.  I did not realize it, but
after years of rationed sugar (even in England) I could not get enough
of it.  In that moment I realized that I have finally arrived in a
land of plenty.


## Waiting for College - 1949

The summer of 1949 was to be filled with anxiety as to where I would
be accepted for entry to college.  As a safe school I enrolled in
Queens College, a tuition-free New York City municipal institution, as
soon as I received my high school credentials.  I could now afford
paying for the various college fees because I was employed as a sales
clerk at the Gertz department store in Jamaica, New York for 65
cents/hour. It was an income that I considered to be generous by my
standards.

My job was to keep in good order a counter where men's Interwoven
socks were on display.  The purchasers, mostly women, had the habit of
messing up the carefully arranged piles of socks.  I was laid off from
this job in April because men's socks did not sell during the summer
months, with a promise of a rehire in the fall.


## The Cooper Union: 1953-1955

While in the Catskills camp I received the news that Cooper Union
would not admit me.  I was not despondent because that would only
delay, but not change my plans.  My daily three-mile bicycle commute
from Forest Hills to Queens College and loads of homework were
pleasant and gave me a great sense of accomplishment.


It was on September 20, 1949 when I received a message that a
Mr. Watson called.  A student, who was enrolled into the Civil
Engineering Department at the Cooper Union, just dropped out.  Could I
show up early next morning and enroll? Although the classes had
already started, I reported the following morning and started on the
path of fulfilling a dream of becoming an engineer in America.


When I graduated as the second highest ranking student in the civil
engineering department of Cooper in May of 1953 (*cum laude* and
member in the engineering honorary society Tau Beta Pi, the honorary
civil engineering society Chi Epsilon and the honorary journalistic
fraternity Sigma Delta Chi).

Mr. Watson was pleased but dismayed.  The disparity between my
admission SAT scores and my academic results rattled his research
findings that SATs offered a reasonable predictability of academic
performance at Cooper.  Mr. Watson pointed out that he could always
show a high correlation between the SAT admission scores and the
scholastic performance at Cooper.  He never had somebody who started
at the bottom and ended up second from the top.
