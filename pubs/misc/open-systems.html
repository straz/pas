<dl><dd><h2>Realising the Value of Open Systems</h2>
<dd>A key underlying issue in information systems is how to preserve strategic
IS assets--applications that represent how the enterprise works and data that
represents its environment. Open systems have a crucial role to play both in
maintaining these assets over time and in indicating a way for people to work
within the enterprise, thereby allowing their full value to be realized.<p>
</dl>

<h3>The Fundamental Balancing Act</h3>

Increasingly, people in every enterprise are facing information technology
budgets that are constrained. Where businesses are expanding, overhead costs
have to come down so that there is room for new applications. Where businesses
are contracting, technology budgets must be reduced. In the case of an
organisation that I know particularly well, the U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) budgets will decline 20 to 30% over the next 6 years.<p>

At the same time that these kinds of budget cuts are being introduced,
organisations are discovering that the assets that are in place no longer meet
the strategic needs of the enterprise--business processes are being rendered
obsolete at such a rapid rate. Consequently, the fundamental issue that has to
be faced by IT managements is the balancing of two forces --reductions in total
costs while preserving the ability to continue at a high rate of application
enhancement and development.<p>

What is dear is that if you introduce new systems that have high maintenance
and operating costs, you are going to use a large portion of the cash that
should otherwise be allocated to the development budget. If you want to
preserve the level of investment in enhancement and development capacity,
savings have to come from operating costs.<p>

Consequently, one of the prime parameters in the implementation of new systems
is the velocity at which they can be injected into your environment because you
need them to generate the operational savings that support further investments.
The driving parameter in this kind of model is time. If you make the time, you
make the money; and so timing becomes a critical element in the realisation of
business value.<p>

However, you need to ensure that the investments that are undertaken not only
generate quick returns, but also create a renewable and permanent asset. What
you have to do is to replace existing systems with systems that have much
longer life.

<h3>Reusable Software</h3>
At the DoD, we identified that half of the potential cost reductions were
achievable through one variable only--reusable software. This is by far the
most critical element in generating cash and business value out of information
systems software investment.<p>

To be economically advantageous, new systems must have substantially lower
maintenance costs than earlier implementations, and they must have a very high
degree of code portability. My minimum target for portability is that after 6
years 60% of the code is portable to the next generation of hardware and
becomes part of the next generation of applications.<p>
The 6-year
cycle is dictated not by hardware technology, which is now on a 2-year
cycle, but by the rate of innovation in business. It is crucial to understand
that it is the internal organisational structure that generates the kind of
information system requirements that lead to investment in new applications.
Therefore, the rate of change of internal procedures and the internal
organisational structure is what governs the rate of replacement of
applications systems -- and any corporation that believes that their procedures
and organisational structure will be able to survive more than 6 years is
working under highly questionable assumptions.

<h3>Residual Value</h3>

This concept of software underlies one of the keys to the evaluation of
software investments--that of the residual value of the investment. The
residual value is the discounted cash flow of your investment today that still
generates utility to the corporation beyond the planning period. In the case of
the U.S. Department of Defense and most U.S. corporations, the planning period
is 6 years, although in electronics that is now shrinking to 4 years.<p>
<p>

<pre>
			1986 	1987 	1988 	1989	1990	1991
Annual Benefits		 0.0 	 0.0 	83.4 	72.3	82.2 	91.4
Annual Costs		63.3 	31.5 	14.5 	15.0 	15.0	17.2

		Net present value of cash benefits @ 25% = 123
		Net present value of cash costs @ 25% = 94
		Benefit/Cost Ratio = (123 - 94)/94 = 31%

		<center><b>Figure A:  Project Benefit/Cost Ratio</b></center>
</pre>
Figure A shows what an investment would look like without residual value--the
way these analyses are usually done. The number that is important is the cash
benefit to cash expenditure ratio of 31%. This allows for the discounting of
future gains, but that is not adequately realised even at a high discount rate
like the 25% that has been used in this example.<p>
<p>

<pre>
		1986 	1987 	1988 	1989	1990	1991	Residual Value
Annual Benefits	 0.0	 0.0	83.4	72.3	82.2	91.4	  340.5
Annual Costs	63.3	31.5	14.5	15.0	15.0	17.2	   64.1

Net present value of cash benefits @ 25% with residual value = 195
Net present value of cash costs @ 25% with residual value = 107
Cash+Residual Benefit/Cost Ratio = (195 - 107)/107 = 81%

<center><b>Figure B: Project Benefit/Cost Ratio with a 12-year Residual Value</b></center>
</pre>

Figure B provides the identical example but with a residual value. The payback
has now gone up to 81%. What this demonstrates is that if the useful life of
the application can be extended beyond the immediate planning period, and thus
the software asset can continue to contribute even in a different
organisational environment, then the return on the investment is almost
trebled.<p>
This method of determining payback is embodied in a piece of software that is
called the Functional Economic Analysis which was developed by the DoD on the
basis of my book <a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/business-value.html">
The Business Value of Computers</a>,  and is generally
available as public domain software. It is dearly in the public interest to
stimulate a standard approach: to determining economic payback using the same
kind of reusable routines. Needless to say, the DoD wants to increase the
residual value of its software developments.

<h3>Maintenance of Permanent Assets</h3>

The question is: How do you extend the residual value?<p>
I suggests that when you look at the total functional cost of an organisation,
the most valuable property is user training. Consequently, rather than looking
at information technology assets as merely particular pieces of hardware that
have to be used until they die, it should be remembered that the fundamental
organisational cost is on the user side of the equation. In the defence
environment, the user cost is particularly severe because the operators have to
use information technology under conditions of extreme stress, and therefore
dissimilar protocols, graphic interfaces and commands are not only costly but
extremely dangerous.<p>

The other crucial long-term
information assets are data and software-- software representing the collective
intelligence of how the enterprise is put together, and data representing the
facts about the environment of the enterprise. Everything in between--equipment
and operating software-- is commodity products that are being rendered obsolete
at a prodigious rate. The current measure of obsolescence of microcomputers,
for instance, is the monthly recline in the prices of Intel 486 based 
micro-computers,
now averaging 6.5% per month. Nothing in the history of mankind has ever
depreciated or been deflated at the rate of 6.5% per month. What is more, it is
considered that over the next decade, the rate at which new technology will
arrive will mean that real obsolescence will increase to about 11% per month.
At this point, technology will have a half-life
of less than 18 months and will dearly be a junkable commodity.<p>
Consequently, the goal of the residual value approach is the preservation of
long-term
assets, such as the behaviour and training contents of your information system
and its supporting intelligence, while ensuring that what is in between--the
hardware and operating system software--can easily be removed. In order to
protect the long-term
assets and to be able to detach obsolescent commodity assets, you have to
create systems and engineering interfaces and tools that keep the long-term
and short-term
assets separated. This is a snap-in,
snap-out,
disposable type of economy that has to be highly standardised. In fact, one way
of looking at the value of open systems is that they make it easier for
customers to obsolete the equipment that lies between their permanent assets.<p>
To achieve this snap-in, snap-out
world requires an integrated computer aided system engineering environment,
I-CASE. I have come to the conclusion that open systems without open systems
tools do not work. You must have a way of bolting onto open systems hardware
"wheels", so that the old superstructure can be removed and replaced with a new
superstructure with very little pain and a very large amount of reusability of
information.<p>
The underlying concept is to have a development environment which has a life of
25 to 30 years. This development environment is not based upon a particular
procedural code or target hardware, but upon the functional processes which
really define the operational rules and requirements. This development approach
employs fourth and fifth-generation
machine independent languages that are specifically targeted at the open
systems environment.<p>
Once you have a development and testing environment against which you can
continually validate the logic of any extensions, the retention of any
particular implementation is not important. The executable code is not
maintained in the object environment, but at the requirements level. This means
that, for instance, if you wish to move the application to a pocket computer
with a special operating system and a unique chip, you can still achieve the
portability of the application to that particular machine, provided, of course,
that it supports open systems interfaces which are in compliance with the
X/Open CAE Specifications.<p>
I want to emphasize the increasing importance of software tools as the key
enabler for bolting together long-term
assets, such as knowledge about the human interface and user training, with
changeable assets of hardware and system software. Open systems toolsets are
the key enabler necessary to obtain the economic value of the open systems
environment.<p>
Are these tools alone sufficient to preserve the long-term
residual value of software investment? I would suggest that in the same way
that operating systems standards, interoperability standards and communications
standards are necessary but are not sufficient to guarantee the preservation of
software investments, tools are necessary but not sufficient. We have to raise
our sights to ensure that organisational knowledge is preserved within our
organisations.

<h3>Software as Collective Organisational Memory</h3>
One way of looking at software is to see it as one element in a continuum of an
organisational communication process. The software represents the agreements
reached, after negotiation and interpretation, on the means users will employ
to communicate with programmers, programmers with machines, and machines with
programmers and users. In order to increase the residual value of the software
assets embedded in databases and computers, there must be a congruence of
understanding and ease of communication among the community that participates
in this process. It has to be extremely adaptable and fairly rapid.
Essentially, programmers, testers, analysts and users must employ open
processes and tools in order to achieve lasting cooperation.<p>
This leads to the startling conclusion that what we call software expense is,
in fact, purely a way of recording expenses that cover meetings, head
scratching and shouting matches. Therefore, if you want real open systems, the
human dimensions of software creation, maintenance and development have to be
open, transparent, easier and more graceful than has traditionally been the
case.<p>

How do you then conserve software assets? You should start to look at software
as a way of codifying how the enterprise does its business. It represents the
collective experience and the collected, accumulated memory of every person who
has ever participated in the conception of that software. You can look at
software development as a collective process, a form of recording
organisational memory and of encapsulating how members of the organisation have
negotiated how they will cooperate. Software should be seen as part of a
continual, evolutionary process rather than something that is designed and then
thrown away.<p>
Organisations have deep roots. This is seen in the accumulation of what we call
organisational culture, that provides a stability which is independent of the
individuals making up the organisation at any particular time.<p>
An organisation, particularly for residual value, must be able to carry its
culture like a genetic code, with only very small mutations from generation to
generation. Software is a form of wealth. In fact, a large number of
organisations today have software assets which are worth more than the tangible
assets on their balance sheet. Thus, the primary purpose of open systems is to
manage that wealth and manage it so that as little as possible is destroyed; so
that it accumulates rather than is replaced.

<h3>Software as the Organisation's Inheritance</h3>     
Consequently, so called legacy systems and legacy software should not be viewed
as something you get rid of so you can start anew, but more like an inheritance
that is to be built upon through continual rejuvenation and replenishment.<p>
Every new system and enhancement should be conceived of as a way to exploit and
increase this legacy value with as little as possible discarded. When you
analyse the structure of information systems you discover it is not the
elements of logic that change, but the way they are put together. In a typical
business application, more than 85% of basic routines deal with information
retrieval, information management and information display. That applies to
accounting, medical, material or inventory systems. We continually throw out
systems even though the fundamental underlying genetic attributes of that
system are the same from application to application. We can no longer afford to
do this, which is why the implementation of an open systems environment really
calls not just for hardware independence, but for a symbiosis between software
preservation at a component level and the hardware. By this means, you can move
as your environment evolves.

<H3>Open Political Structure</h3>

The open system is a political dimension which perhaps has not been adequately
talked about, but is nevertheless essential because it is the openness of
political structures which allows people to work together without hostility and
in a spirit of cooperation.<p>
My conclusion is that open systems are there to provide the infrastructure that
allows graceful accommodation by the organisation to changing administrative
processes and to changing relationships with vendors and customers. Therefore,
the underlying reason why you want to have open systems is not because you want
to buy cheap hardware, though you may want to do that too, but ultimately
because you want to be able gracefully to evolve your business processes on 6-monthly
or 4-monthly cycles, rather than the years it takes today. Ultimately, the
winning ticket that will show in the residual value of functional economic
analysis is business process redesign.

<h3>Architectures</h3>
It takes more than standards for interfacing hardware and software to really
build a viable collective organisational memory. There needs to be an overall
model or architecture which governs the methods and location of information
retention. Unfortunately, the word architecture is perhaps the most abused and
misused term in today's business system conversations. It is so overused that
it ceases to have meaning. Since I am a student of history I like to look at
solutions which have some precedence in history as being survivable solutions.
Therefore, rather than the traditional building analogy, I prefer to look at
approaches to societal design. Humankind has looked at various forms of
organising civilised society-- we have had monarchies and dictatorships--but so
far our experience suggests that the most survivable institutional framework
for the peaceful growth of individuals and the development of social wealth is
what is called a layered society - a federation. This constitutional structure
maintains that there are intermediate points between monarchy and absolutism at
one end of the scale, and anarchy at the other. Complex societies must have
many layers with the appropriate layer performing certain functions. If a
particular function is not preserved for a specific layer, it is automatically
delegated down and decentralised. It is really the concept of governance called
confederation. Federation is not absolutist, but nor is it decentralised.<p>
There is sharing.<p>
Given the organisational premise outlined above--that software is a form of
organisational memory for complex organisations--I would like to suggest a
model that is neither centralised nor fully decentralised as being appropriate.
In this model, used in the DoD, the various software assets have to be put into
the right level of a federal structure.

<h3>Enterprise Level</h3>
The enterprise level is where you maintain policy, standards, reference models,
data management tools, integrated systems, database configuration and software
configuration. In order to be able to change a component of this open systems
environment and enable rapid change at the local application level, you
maintain very long-term
assets at this the highest level in the federal structure. Primary attention at
the enterprise level should focus on structures and constructs which are 25 to
50 years out. Once the data definition and data elements have been agreed for
the enterprise, they should be pretty well immutable; independent of
technology, hardware and applications.

<H3>Local Level</H3>
At the local level, where you are looking at query languages, customised
applications, prototyping, local applications and <i>ad hoc </i>simulations,
the time scale is measured in days or weeks. Somewhere between 50 years and a
day or week there are functions which you assign to the intermediate levels in
the organisation. These intermediate levels are where you can locate your open
systems assets. In the DoD, for instance, the large databases which are
application independent are maintained at the functional level. They are not
modified more than maybe once every ten years when major changes in technology
are introduced, but even then it should be possible to migrate these databases
to new technology in the new environment.<p>
What I am suggesting is that if you really preserve the collective knowledge of
the enterprise, there is large residual value from software development. You
cannot simply look at interoperability standards, you have to look at what I
consider the rules of governance, or the way the organisation is put together.
You need to ensure that you put as much of the investment as possible in long-lasting
assets like data, the telecommunications structure, and configuration
management. However, at the same time it is important that innovation, which is
fleeting, local and absolutely essential as a way of preserving a sense of
freedom and independence, is not stifled. The beauty of this kind of approach
is that when you develop local applications that turn out to have permanent
value because they are widely imitated, they can be quickly moved up in the
hierarchy. It is extremely important that the whole idea of the dynamics of
innovation is preserved in the layered structure.

<h3>Preserving Personal Privacy</h3>
Within any architecture, personal privacy that is exempted from standards must
be preserved. I am a strong believer that you cannot impose standards
everywhere. There must be a line at which individuals who have on their desktop
the power of a Cray super computer should be able to do whatever they want as
long as they do not cause damage to the wider organisation. Similarly, no
enterprise lives solely within itself, it lives within the society at large,
and therefore the architecture must also provide for interoperability with
others in the industry, with suppliers, with vendors and with service providers.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
The open systems movement should not be seen as dealing with a rang of
technical devices, but as one of the most critical elements of effective
information management. Open systems become the matrix within which we embed
information systems that preserve the value of organisations. The payoffs are
enormous not just in preserving hardware and software assets, but most
importantly in making organisations viable, competitive and flexible.<p>
Thus, the underlying issue of open systems--the preservation of assets-- is
bigger than just standards. It really deals with the governance and
constitutionality of the structure of the information society. It is concerned
with how this is organised within the enterprise and then how enterprises are
organised to cooperate as a national and then global society.<p>
