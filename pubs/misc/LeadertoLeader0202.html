My interest in measuring information technology leadership goes back a
very long way, to October 14, 1974.  That was the day that I - then
the chief information officer of Xerox Corporation - appeared before
the Board of Directors to present a proposal for 1975-1976 IT
spending. <p>

To my misfortune, Xerox had just recorded a steep decline in profit
and revenue growth.  The increase in my IT budget exceeded the
anticipated revenue increases for the coming year.  All the Board
wished to hear was how the proposed outlays for IT spending
contributed to the profitability of Xerox.  On the surface this
appeared a simple enough request, but after some analysis and
reflection it became clear that the request was far from simple. <p>

In 1974 I was responsible for Xerox's global IT spending.  There were
86 operating units, each spending a great deal of money on IT-and I
couldn't be sure that the IT money was being spent prudently.  The
stark reality was that there was no way I could perform global
cost-benefit analysis to anybody's satisfaction.  When I looked at my
peers in other companies it became clear that none of them could prove
how IT related directly to corporate profits, either. <p>

What was true in 1974 with regard to cost justification of IT still
holds true for most corporations.  Multidivisional global corporations
have serious difficulty even discovering their total level of IT
spending.  When they then attempt to correlate IT spending with
divisional profitability (something I have done quite often) the
resulting patterns are random and completely unrelated.  In government
agencies the problems of evaluating the contributions of IT are much
worse: since the value of services cannot be measured there is no way
one can evaluate the benefits of overall IT spending with overall IT
benefits except by making the preposterous assumption that all work
would be performed only using pencils and paper.<p>

In the absence of a rigorous discipline for measuring the effects of
IT on results, thousands of corporate and government leaders are
suffering from a case of the Emperor's New Clothes: they believe that
their investments in IT are sound, reasonable, and productive because
everyone else believes that as well.  What is lacking, however, are
proofs that their assumptions apply in their particular situation.
Unfortunately, in the rush to spend money on the latest and best IT
the result is that many corporations' IT infrastructures are draining
economic value every day.  The reason for that is not that the
technologies are intrinsically faulty.  The economic drain arises from
applying IT to solving the wrong problems or in using IT to magnify or
accelerate undesirable business practices.<p>

Many corporate leaders are blinkered from this truth by the continual
hyping of IT in the media and by market consulting firms who conduct
IT leadership polls.  These polls are unreliable, in part because of
small sample sizes but chiefly because the questions are asked of IT
proponents or staff personnel with no way of judging the effectiveness
of IT. <p>

Voting on IT leadership by calling IT proponents is intriguing, cheap,
and a totally useless way to judge whether leadership is or isn't
present in a company.  For instance, in September 2000, a well-known
U.S.  IT magazine ranked 500 companies by their IT leadership
achievement.  3Com came out as number one in that ranking.  A few
months later 3Com was undergoing massive layoffs and its stock price
was in free fall.  As a rule, failing firms are always more likely to
beautify their accomplishments. <p>

Another popular method of identifying technology leadership is to look
at IT outlays.  In 1964, professor Dick Nolan presented this
hypothesis (to be widely known as the "Stages of Growth Hypothesis")
in an article in the Harvard Business Review.  There he basically said
that the company that increases its IT spending faster than others
leads the parade in maturity and accomplishment.  Today there are a
number of consulting firms that produce annual rankings.  These are
largely based on the assumption that higher levels of spending equal
greater sophistication and leadership.

I have learned that IT alone cannot save a company's leadership or
strategic dilemmas.  Believing it will do so can distract leaders and
drain precious resources. <p>

What few people take the trouble to do is to correlate spending with
actual economic outcomes, such as profits after taxes, or even better,
economic value added (EVA).  I have done such analyses for 2,865 U. S.
industrial corporations.  In each case I plotted IT outlays per
employee against rates of return on equity (ROE) producing a
completely random distribution.  Clearly such a scatter plot shows
that there is zero correlation between IT spending and economic
outcomes.  But what else does the data indicate? Does it mean that
that the leaders of the companies with negative returns are stupid?
And the people in the positive zone are great leaders?<p>

No.  The essence of leadership lies in how an individual leader
balances and mixes the ingredients of strategic influence to deliver
the most effective results.  For a quick thumbnail of these factors,
I've listed below 12 key determinants of competitive success.  The
tabulation indicates which conditions are either favorable or
unfavorable to profitability.  You may observe that prowess in IT is
not one of them-IT is a weak and secondary influence that only makes
its effects visible through improving (or deteriorating) one of the
primary sources of competitive success. <p>

I have found that by and large most of the companies in any given
industry use the same information technology.  It is unlikely that you
will find demonstrably obsolete IT anywhere in corporate America
(government agencies will be an exception to this rule).  U. S.  firms
tend to hire technical personnel with comparable qualifications.  IT
professionals tend to go to the same conferences and know just as much
about IT as their rivals.  Accordingly, examination of the equipment
or the IT people cannot be the deciding factor separating companies
that are losers from those that are winners. <p>

So the disparity between great profits and dismal losses cannot be
accounted for by studying IT spending.  Why then is it that over 33
percent of U. S.  corporations deliver profits that are insufficient
to earn the cost of shareholder capital (that is, deliver a positive
EVA) when from an IT spending standpoint the losers are not distinctly
different from superior performers? Most of the answer to this puzzle
can be found in what I believe is the most rigorous effort ever
mounted to measure leadership and performance, the PIMS program
started in 1965 by General Electric.  <p>

In 1974 it became the Cambridge, MA-based <a
href="http://www.pimsonline.com">Strategic Planning Institute</a>.
PIMS answers the question of drivers of profitability as well as
anything I have ever observed anywhere else.  Incidentally (and in the
spirit of full disclosure), I served on its board of directors in the
early 1980s. <p>

For over 20 years, PIMS has been gathering information based on
reporting of confidential data by more than 3,000 business units
belonging to over 300 corporations.  I also believe that one of the
reasons for GE's consistent ranking as one of the most profitable
companies in the world is that the PIMS way of thinking has been
embedded in its management and leadership styles.  PIMS offers an
excellent methodology for diagnosing the impact of different
strategies.  PIMS obtains its insights by an examination of relevant
data from healthy businesses that have consistently shown leadership,
profitability, and growth.  The measurable traits of the healthy
businesses have then been correlated with every other conceivable
ingredient of success and used to shed light on the drivers of profit.
<p>

This massive body of evidence from PIMS conclusively shows that
operating effectiveness- namely how efficient you are, how quickly you
get your invoices out, how quickly you get your personal records
straightened out, and so forth is important, but less so than
proponents of IT tend to advocate.  Not more than 15 percent of the
factors of profitability can be attributed to operating effectiveness.
Clearly a company can be very efficient as it marches rapidly toward
oblivion.  I've seen it happen. <p>

That does not mean that one should disregard operating effectiveness
and forget about invoicing.  All this means that what really
differentiates corporations is their competitive position, that is,
their strategic positioning as well as the strategic moves they make
in order to achieve greater advantage against their competitors who
are also trying to achieve similar gains.  The belief that
advantageous strategic positioning is the decisive key to corporate
profitability is now supported by compelling evidence.
