Turning our upside down world right side up</H2>

</P>

<P>Usually the budget and administration realm of DoD doesn't offer much
hot news. However, since Mr. Paul Strassmann, Director of Defense Information,
started righting our skewed world, it's the topic. </P>

<P>Government Computer News, Federal Computer Week and every other computer
trade journal have printed numerous speculations about who is going to
do what to and for whom when the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
becomes central manager of the defense information infrastructure. Since
the media have no official government ties, they're free to speculate away.
As an official government magazine, we can only talk about what has been
signed into reality. No speculation allowed - at least nothing overt. </P>

<P>I went to Mr. Strassmann's office hoping for the specific nuts and bolts
of the Defense Management Report Decision 918, Subj: Defense Information
Infrastructure, the infamous DMRD 918. Mr.Strassmann declined to discuss
the document's guts, preferring not to upstage Assistant Secretary of Defense
Andrews. </P>

<P>What Mr. Strassmann did give me was insight into his motives and methods
for this massive DoD reorganization. As he put it, &quot;In the past when
DoD has cut the budget, we've pulled teeth. This time we're going to cut
the administrative tail.&quot; </P>

<P>Mr. Strassmann promised me a return engagement after 918 is born. In
the meantime.... </P>
<hr>

<P><B>Chips</B>: When DISA finally goes on line with the majority of the
support functions that have traditionally belonged to the individual services,
what is it going to mean to the men and women in the ships, tanks and trenches?
Are they going to actually feel the difference? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>I'm very glad you're asking that question because
it gives me the opportunity to talk about the general philosophy of information
management. What has to be understood is that information is management
and management is really an issue of how you govern. In a civilized society,
you must have certain rules and certain order and certain expectations
in the infrastructure so that in the privacy of your home you are not bound
by the government. The reason that you can buy a toaster with confidence
is that some utility has seen fit to put in the power grid and transformers
and made sure the voltage doesn't fluctuate. </P>

<P>The bottom line so far as I'm concerned is that in standardizing the
infrastructure, we will make it possible to move over 80 percent and perhaps
as much as 90 percent of the computing power out to the consumer. </P>

<P>The underlying direction of the executive level group which I served
on prior to coming here was to make the awesome computing power available
to the platoon leader or an executive officer on a small frigate and to
have all the resources and all the data available and consistent. He shouldn't
have to fill out the same forms over and over with the same name, same
social security number, same pay grade on all of those forms. We have 10,000
forms. None of them are compatible. </P>

<P>So, I want to very emphatically answer your question about what it all
means. It means that we are going to regulate and retain certain important
rights at the DoD level which are the compatibility of data, infrastructure
and communications. The objective is to move computing power all the way
down to the lowest level where it is consumed. </P>

<P><B>Chips:</B> How is the decentralization of the computing power going
to work on a reimbursable basis? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>The only way you can have freedom for the individual
if you're a market economy, and this is the American way, is for the customer
to be able to make a decision. The customer can spend his budget buying
shrubbery or buying more information or going without information. Ultimately,
you cannot have decision makers sitting in the Pentagon deciding what screen
someone may want to look at at midnight on 21 January in the year 2002.
Those people should have a choice on what screen they want to look at or
if they want to look at a screen at all. </P>

<P>If they have the mechanism to make a decision, they can buy as they
choose. This is the American way; this is decentralization. It's the market
economy. </P>

<P>Chips: For many years, the majority of the military community has existed
on the principle of mission funding. Will it be difficult for them to adapt?
</P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>As long as we were engaged in wholesale war with
one enemy, such as the Soviet Union, you could run your warfare from a
central command. You were basically moving chess pieces. With low intensity
warfare, it's the lieutenant going down the street in a HumVee who has
to make decisions. That lieutenant in that HumVee must have a computer
so he can decide whether to continue driving, redeploy, ask for help or
attack. </P>

<P>He needs an enormous amount of information such as what ammunition is
coming or whether the rifleman has really been trained to launch certain
kinds of missiles. </P>

<P>Editor's Note: Some government activities are accustomed to working
on a reimbursable basis. That's particularly true in the Navy computer
and telecommunications activities where the Navy Industrial Fund philosophy
was adopted in 1985. </P>

<P>Chips: How will you separate administrative ADP from tactical ADP? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>There's no difference. When I'm deployed, I have
to know where my ammunition is, where my backup supply is, the state of
my aircraft readiness and the weather forecast. One computer has to tell
all that. </P>

<P>Chips: Are the armed services complaining about the scope of functions
that DISA is planning to absorb? What do the services feel they should
retain? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>We have had debates, and it isn't just the services.
There are debates because people don't trust the system. </P>

<P>If the electric supply isn't very reliable and you have intermittent
failures, you're going to buy yourself a gasoline generator and keep it
on standby because you don't trust those guys in the utility. Trust becomes
the important unit. </P>

<P>The way information flows in DoD right now there isn't much trust because
everyone takes care of themselves. That's the way mankind has been for
most of its history. The very idea of having a civilized society is being
able to go to the supermarket for a quart of milk. There is a whole structure
behind it. For you to walk into a supermarket and buy a quart of milk is
a giant achievement of trust. Thousands of people had a role in that quart
of milk. We'll have to earn that level of trust like all other trusts that
exist everywhere. </P>

<P>Editor's Note: Judging from some of the early replies to the DMRD 918,
the &quot;debates&quot; that Mr. Strassmann referred to are fairly heated
concerning the definition or the very existence of &quot;tactical ADP.&quot;
</P>

<P>Chips: What about the security across our LANs and within our PCs? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>It becomes vital because our networks become the
prime target for an adversary of the United States. However, we must stop
trying to achieve security by taking a particular machine and tempest proofing
and debugging it. That can't be done so simply. That's why they haven't
done it. Security is systems wide. You have to start with an architecture,
and you have to design security into the network. You're not going to have
a secure work station. Work stations have slots where anyone can slip in
a diskette. You're dead right there if someone uses it to extract forbidden
info or slip in a virus or worse. </P>

<P>We have to start with a secure design for a secure network. We also
need authorization. In other words, I can only offer you security if there
is a gatekeeper who knows when you sign off and on and can verify your
signature. I must have a system for gatekeepers. To try to isolate and
secure one PC, is nonsense. </P>

<P>One of the primary justifications for CIM is security. There are physical
security issues where someone comes in and blows the thing up. One of the
reasons we're centralizing is that we have 1700 data centers. There isn't
enough money in the DoD budget to harden 1700 centers. Forget about it.
What you have to do is pick a few baskets, put the eggs in those few baskets
and watch those eggs. We must design a system where any one of those baskets
can die or any two or three, and you will still survive. </P>

<P>Chips: Aren't we consolidating and putting our eggs in that basket before
we have created the method for watching the eggs? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>I'm not going to sign up to anything that would conform
to what you said. </P>

<P>Chips: What is the future of our microcomputer umbrella contracts? Are
there going to be anymore huge microcomputer contracts? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>Prices are dropping at the rate of 6 percent per
month. We can't have big contracts with prices dropping like pork bellies
when there is lots of corn around. You can't do that. You can't have three-year
contracts. </P>

<P>Chips: How are we going to procure micros? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>After the 918 is signed, I'll explain that to you.
For now I'll tell you, we're going to buy micros the way we buy commodities
- on the spot market in small quantities. If you need some, we'll buy you
some and ship it to you Federal Express. </P>

<P>The technology cycle is two years. If it takes you five years to get
a contract in place, you've already lost. I've just taken a look at the
age distribution of some of our mainframes we bought seven years after
they were introduced. A mainframe on a seven-year cycle means it's just
about ready to be junked from a technology standpoint. We buy it for top
dollar, and then we keep it another 14 years. That is not smart. </P>

<P>We have over 600 acquisition points for micros. Buying micros is providing
much employment in this town. Look around this building and watch what
people do. They're filling out GSA forms. </P>

<P>Don't lay all of the acquisition protests on the vendors. There are
lots of willing people who keep very employed for a long time writing these
specifications. That's just not a good way to save money. </P>

<P>Chips: A lot of people are worried about these massive consolidations
and personnel shifts. What are you going to do with the people displaced
by the consolidations? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>In drawing down the Department of Defense, we'll
end up with 600,000 fighting people. Maybe less. Who knows. The issue is
what's called a tooth to tail ratio. The Marines understand. </P>

<P>There will only be so much cash. The question is: Will we have the money
for fighting power or will we have the money to support paper pushers?
If I have anything to say about it, we will free the money that today is
spent on non-defense overhead and use it to maintain our military strength.
</P>

<P>In years past, the reaction to budget reductions was: Let's cut B2s
and make fewer tanks. Let's take down another 120 ships. Let's pull our
teeth. </P>

<P>That isn't the way to manage a draw down. The way you manage a draw
down is to cut the overhead. The administrative tail is there because we've
tolerated it. The underlying idea of CIM is to look at the overhead costs.
</P>

<P>Chips: Has implementing the CIM structure been more difficult than you
anticipated? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>It's easier. We are way ahead of where I expected
we'd be a year and a half ago. This is a delightful place. This is the
first time the chairman of the board has given me exact goals such as,
&quot;We're going to cut this much, and this is where it's coming from.
&quot;Or have the chief operating executive, which is the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, say, &quot;By the way, this is the kind of a fighting
system I need.&quot; I didn't get that in Xerox. Here they tell you what
they expect. They don't know exactly how to do it, although they have some
ideas. For the first time in 35 years, I've had it laid out for me. </P>

<P>Of course someone has to know how to carry out the details. If you don't
have clear objectives, hard work won't get you there. This is the best
job I've ever had. </P>

<P>There is less politics here than there was at Xerox. Let me tell you
why. At Xerox the bonuses were big. Here we all get paid the same way.
You can't make a killing. People aren't here to get rich. This is sort
of a genteel organization - with some exceptions. I just want everyone
to know DoD is just delightful. </P>

<P>Chips: Look at what you've accomplished with the CIMs. DFAS is off and
running and the medical people are doing it. Even DLA is a year ahead of
schedule. Why is the computer community behind? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>That's easy. Functions come first; computers come
second. We first have to straighten out the objectives to know what we're
doing. Computers come last. The problem for the last 20 years is that computers
came first, and then you were looking for solutions. CIM puts it the other
way around. CIM says, &quot;After we know what we're going to do, then
we'll look at computers.&quot; </P>

<P>Editor's Note: DFAS' principal role is to meet day-to-day payrolls,
bill paying and accounting record postings for the Department. DFAS is
also the primary agent to analyze the financial business area to streamline
how the Department does its financial business. This includes eliminating
non-value-added actions and processes through improvement of business practices.
This will take into account changing technology, changing requirements
and changing policies which have been instituted or are being directed
since the time current processes were developed. Extracted from the Status
of the CIM Initiative, April 92. </P>

<P>Chips: Why has the Navy been slow in consolidating their DPIs? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>The $235M they're going to make is not the big money
for CIM. The Navy is behind, but they came up with a good plan. But DPI
consolidation is about 1.5 percent of the total $71 billion target. The
big money is functional money. The big money isn't computer savings. The
big money savings are logistics, supply, inventory, medical, clerical and
administrative. Computers will support whatever they will need. </P>

<P>We have frozen the growth of computer expenditures in DoD while the
rest of the government has gone up 23 percent. We are now down $760M with
or without Navy consolidation. </P>

<P>The Information Centers are part of the attempt to give the consumer
the capability to be a customer. We are leaving programmers and support
people at all the bases so those people can locally do their own applications.
We're going to bless much ofthe bootleg stuff. A large share of the really
useful applications in DoD is bootleg. </P>

<P>The Army, Air Force and Navy look up to CIM and say, &quot;You want
to centralize everything.&quot; When you look down they are the biggest
centralists you ever saw! We are trying to eliminate the unproductive middle.
We are trying to centralize things so you don't need all this middle flow
so that people down on the receiving end can really accomplish something
useful. </P>

<P>Chips: What would you like to personally tell the people who man our
ships, planes and tanks? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>When the 918 is signed, I'll give you a good interview.
What you can tell the troops is that the underlying idea is to create an
infrastructure with coherent data and coherent standards so that the people
can have more power. That's the message I want to convey. </P>

<P>Chips: As CIM really gears up and you start to absorb more functions
and more people, are you going to physically consolidate people? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>No! I don't believe in consolidation. That's the
lastthing to do. When we took over the computer assets of the Defense Finance
and Accounting Service (DFAS), I said, &quot;What's the bestplace given
the standard of living and community relations that'sthe furthest from
Washington?&quot; People said, &quot;How about Colorado?&quot; and I said,
What a great idea.&quot; </P>

<P>When the Defense Information Technology Services Organization (DITSO)
was created there was an MOU that the headquarters would be in Crystal
City. It ended up in Denver. I believe in having things in the mid-west,
the south and distributed. I don't believe an organization should be so
big that the commanding officer can't know everyone's name. I believe we
should be in small communities close to educational institutions where
the quality of living is good. If it works where it is, I'll leave it alone.
Why move. It's costly and disrupts people. We'd have real problems. Why
shuffle people. I don't believe in moving people when we don't have to.
For example, my wife stayed in Connecticut. She didn't want to come to
Washington so I commute now. </P>

<P>We are going to invest in a very superior communications system. Rather
than move people into some big building here in Washington, I believe much
of the work must be done electronically. </P>

<P><em>Editor's Note: According to Federal Computer Week, Aug 24, 1992, &quot;DITSO
was established May 10th as a fee-for-service utility, operating processing
centers and CDAs transferred to it from DFAS and DLA. DITSO plans to develop
standard hardware, software and tools for these centers, including software
engineering tools for use in all its centers. Denver-based DITSO expects
the new centers will bring an extra 4,500 military and civilian staff under
its wing by Oct. 1.&quot; </em></P>

<P>Chips: How close are we to having a fully computerized end-to-end method
of buying computers, including electronic signatures? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>It's off for a while. DLA actually does it now with
small contracts. The Defense Communications Contract Office (DECCO) is
going to be the purchasing agent for DISA and will be located at Scott
AFB. They have the infrastructure, Scott AFB is the right place for them,
and they have the skill and leadership. </P>

<P>With the proper diagnostics network in place, someone will be able to
tell if your terminal is up or your modem is down. When you go down they
will know it before you do. </P>

<P>Chips: If we're going to have the capability of transferring information
from end to end without any hand holders in between, isn't absolute standardization
mandatory? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>You've got it! As a matter of fact, the 918 is really
a huge decentralization effort. </P>

<P>Chips: Will DECCO also control the help desks (technical support)? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>No. That's network control. They'll be control for
contracts and requirements, yes. But not the help desk for the network,
particularly for helping people and for teaching and education. That's
a separate issue. </P>

<P><em>Editor's Note: I tried to finesse my way back into the 918 but Mr. Strassmann
was too quick. </em></p>

<p>Chips: Micro education is going to come under the National
Defense University isn't it? 

<p>Strassmann: My, you do have a very early version
of the 918, don't you. You're about six versions behind. 

<p>Chips: Ah well, I thought I might be one or two ... 

<p>Strassmann: (Obviously enjoying himself)
No, you're way behind. There are two ways of keeping secrets or protecting
software. Because everyone copies software, if you're a manufacturer, you
either button it up, which is hard to do, or you change it so often that
people just give up. We did the latter. </P>

<P>Chips: Who is going to handle the actual contract customer who buys
a PC? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>First of all you're not going to be buying PCs. You're
going to lease PCs from DISA. They are going to be responsible for technology.
If your leased PC goes down, they will check and see if you've pulled out
the pins. We'll do a remote diagnostic and loop tests. Perhaps we'll find
the motherboard is gone. Most likely you didn't provide proper circuit
protection and you had a storm. Now you have a dead PC. We're going to
ship you a new one by Federal Express. You'll unpack it and put your dead
one into the same box and ship it back. That's only six months in the future.
</P>

<P>Once you're on the network, network control is going to watch you all
the way down to the keyboard. Network control won't be able to look at
the contents of what you're doing, but electronically they will be able
to validate that you're authorized to have that technology revision and
that you're authorized to create data and update files. </P>

<P>American Express does it to every reader, in every store. American Air
Lines does it, and every banking terminal is done that way. The first batch
of networks will have this capability in six months. </P>

<P>Chips: How will PC leasing work? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>DISA will have a price list. Similar to a GSA schedule.
You can get a short- or long-term lease. Not only will they lease you the
equipment, they'll maintain it. They'll guarantee the up time for your
machine. If you want an upgrade, most likely we'll give it to you. </P>

<P>The big cost is maintenance. It's expensive to make a maintenance call.
It costs about $200 per call. We intend to do depot maintenance the way
Dell does. Dell is the fastest growing computer company in the United States
because they're doing superbcustomer service. </P>

<P>The machines we're going to buy are the ones we can upgrade. Because
if we own it, we should have that machine out there for eight years. Which
means we should put it through two or three technology lives. We're going
to buy chips and populate the boards with new technology every two or three
years. </P>

<P>All the systems will be compatible open systems. And they'll have the
circuitry so we can do remote diagnostics in order to save maintenance
costs. </P>

<P>Chips: If I lease my PC from you, can I call you and tell you I want
a new Macintosh and you'll just send it to me? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>Yes, if the Macintosh is on the approved list as
an open system, and we know the job you're doing requires it. For example,
if you generate data entries, we download the approved software to you.
What you do with your local applications is your problem, but while you're
on the job and generating payroll entries or financial or technical engineering
data, that software will be under central control. </P>

<P>Chips: When you say central control, that's an enormous operation. What
kind of network is going to handle this? Who's going to operate it, and
where is it going to be housed? </P>

<P><B>Strassmann: </B>It's going to be an ATM network. It's a packet switch,
multiplex network based on the latest technology. It won't be circuit switching.
It's going to be housed in hardened sites. They will have to guarantee
the authenticity of the financial entries. They're issuing money based
on that thing. They can't just sit there and get E-Mail messages, &quot;Send
me another $1,000,000.&quot; They can't do that. This is like the banking
business. The essence of the DoD network of the future will be guaranteed
security and reliability. </P>

<h3>A Peek Into Our Future </h3>

<P>As I told you in the lead to Mr. Strassmann's interview, as a government
magazine,<B><I> Chips</I></B> isn't allowed to indulge in much speculation.
However, just this once I'll take a chance and slip you a few tidbits.
Take this information with a grain of salt, and don't pack your bags for
a move to Denver. All I want to do is give you a feel for the scope of
the reorganization. Nothing is concrete yet. </P>

<P>DISA as central manager of the defense information infrastructure will
be responsible for security, standards, communications, computing, CDAs,
acquisitions and education. That covers a great deal of territory indeed.
Some of the specific actions that will be taken under the following elements
of central management include: </P>

<li><P>Security. Providing funding to support enhanced information security
protection and establishing DISA as the DoD focal point to oversee the
application of security protection. </P>

<li><P>Standards. IT standards, assets and personnel will be assigned to DISA
IT Standards Program Office to establish the IT standards program as a
high priority effort. </P>

<li><P>Communications. Communications will be consolidated under DISA and personnel
involved in network management and control, communications management and
system engineering will be assigned to DISA. </P>

<li><P>Computing. DISA will be responsible for central management,workload
control, systems engineering, technical cross-functional integration centers,
standards and planning for DPIs. DISA will be responsible for central systems
engineering, technical integration, standards and systems architecture
including distributed office automation systems. Assets and personnel involved
in these management and control functions will be assigned to DISA. </P>

<li><P>CDAs. CDA assets and personnel associated with software design, development,
reengineering, maintenance, systems integration and common support activities
will be assigned to DISA. Common support functions include workload control,
system development guidance and tools, data administration, software repositories
and application development process and assessment improvement programs.
</P>

<li><P>Acquisition. Assets and personnel for acquisition of IT components and
services will be assigned to DISA. The primary acquisition methods for
products will be new procurements, selected existing contracts, leases
where economically feasible, reutilized IT equipment systems and existing
and emerging software repositories. </P>

<li><P>Education. A designated executive agent will develop specific educational
and training standards, curriculum, and delivery systems and develop IT
career paths and certification standards and programs. </P>
