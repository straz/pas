In a nation of technophiles, where Internet millionaires are minted
daily, it seems heresy to question the economic payoff from
information technology -- the billions upon billions spent each year
by companies and households on everything from computers to software
to cell phones.

But for more than a decade, most of the nation&rsquo;s leading economists have been heretics.

&ldquo;You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity
statistics,&rdquo; Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Prize winner from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, once said.

For years, even as the computer revolutionized the workplace,
&ldquo;measured productivity&rdquo; -- the output of goods and services per
worker -- stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a year. So it is easy
to see how Mr. Solow&rsquo;s pithy comment became the favorite punch line of
the economic naysayers.

Yet today, even renowned skeptics on the subject of technology&rsquo;s
contribution to the economy, like Mr. Solow, are having second
thoughts. Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996, capped
by a surge in the second half of last year, after eight years of
economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past upward
swings in productivity typically occurred early in a recovery as
economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased hiring, it
slowed again.

But something seems fundamentally different this time. It apparently
relates to the increased speed and efficiency that information
technology advances -- including the Internet -- is finally bringing
to the mundane day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses.

The question, posed by economists, is whether the higher productivity
growth averaging about 2 percent in the last three years, roughly
double the pace from 1973 to 1995, is the long-awaited confirmation
that the nation&rsquo;s steadily rising investment in computers and
communications is finally paying off. The evidence is starting to
point in that direction.

&ldquo;My beliefs are shifting on this subject,&rdquo; Mr. Solow said. &ldquo;I am
still far from certain. But the story always was that it took a long
time for people to use information technology and truly become more
efficient. That story sounds a lot more convincing today than it did a
year or two ago.&rdquo;

Another pillar in the pessimist camp was Daniel E. Sichel, an
economist at the Federal Reserve. His work, along with another Fed
economist, Stephen D. Oliner, in 1994, and on his own in 1997, found
that computers contributed little to economic growth. But recently,
Mr. Sichel ran similar calculations for the last few years and came to
a different conclusion.

In a paper that has just been published in the quarterly Business
Economics, he wrote that his new work points to &ldquo;a striking step up
in the contribution of computers to output growth.&rdquo; And the nation&rsquo;s
improved productivity performance, he noted, is &ldquo;raising the
possibility that businesses are finally reaping the benefits of
information technology.&rdquo;

# Wanted: New Way To Measure Economy

The impact of information technology on the economy is more than an
academic debate. If, as some experts assert, the technology dividend
is a key reason for the nation&rsquo;s extraordinary run of high growth,
rising wages and low inflation, there are significant policy
implications. If the recent gains are not just a temporary blip, it
suggests that the Federal Reserve can be less fearful of inflation and
keep interest rates stable rather than be forced to raise them to cool
off what would otherwise be considered an overheated economy. The Fed
chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the other Fed governors are scheduled to
hear presentations on information technology&rsquo;s effect on the economy
from several academics during a private meeting in Washington
tomorrow.

Mr. Greenspan, for one, seems to believe a fundamental change is under
way in the economy. He told Congress in January that the economy is
enjoying &ldquo;higher, technology-driven productivity growth.&rdquo;

The Fed governors will hear a forceful case for technological optimism
from Erik Brynjolfsson, an associate professor at the M.I.T. Sloan
School of Management.

Mr. Brynjolfsson asserts that the economic value of speed, quality
improvements, customer service and new products are often not captured
by Government statistics. &ldquo;These are the competitive advantages of
information technology,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need a broader definition of
output in this new economy, which goes beyond the industrial-era
concept of widgets coming off the assembly line.&rdquo;

The Government, after years of defending its figures, conceded two
weeks ago that productivity growth may be understated. The core of the
problem, Government economists say, is the increasingly complex
challenge of defining and measuring output in much of the economy&rsquo;s
fast-growing service sector, which includes the vast reaches of
banking, finance, health care and education.

According to the official statistics, for instance, a bank today is no
more productive than a bank was two decades ago. Yet that seems to
take scant account of, say, 24-hour automated teller machines, which
clearly benefit customers who no longer have to wait in lines to be
served by human tellers during regular &ldquo;bankers&rsquo; hours.&rdquo;

Edwin R. Dean, chief of the productivity division of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, wrote in a recent research paper that the agency is
increasingly concerned that its measurements do not &ldquo;fully reflect
changes in the quality of goods and services&rdquo; or &ldquo;capture the full
impact of new technology on economic performance.&rdquo;

Still, the Government&rsquo;s methods of measurement will not be overhauled
anytime soon. &ldquo;These are tough, tough questions and we are not going
to get instant solutions,&rdquo; Mr. Dean said in an interview.

# Revolution Unfolds In the Back Offices

American corporations long ago made up their minds, voting for
technology with their dollars. Investment in information technology --
computing and telecommunications gear -- has quadrupled over the last
decade, rising as a share of all business spending on equipment to 53
percent from 29 percent, according to the Commerce Department. And
that is only the hardware. There have been surges in corporate
spending on software, consulting, technical support and training
related to the field.

&ldquo;The payoff from information technology is unquestionably there with
individual companies and we&rsquo;re seeing it over and over again,&rdquo; said
Chuck Rieger, a senior consultant at I.B.M.&rsquo;s services division.

Of course, anecdotal evidence from individual companies is no proof of
broad-based benefits in an $8.5 trillion economy. But what many
experts find encouraging is that the rapid introduction of low-cost
Internet technology means most companies can now afford to set up
electronic links with customers and suppliers. For example, a recent
survey of 2,500 manufacturing companies, conducted by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, found that the number of factories with
Internet links to customers and suppliers doubled last year.

At more and more companies, these Internet-based networks are already
streamlining the mundane chores of business life like invoicing,
purchasing and inventory control. This is not the glamorous side of
Internet commerce, occupied by Amazon.com and others selling consumer
products. Yet if a technology dividend in productivity is at hand, the
place to look is in the back offices of business. &ldquo;That is where it
will be,&rdquo; Mr. Solow, the M.I.T economist, said, &ldquo;in the wholesale
automation of corporate transactions.&rdquo;

This business-to-business commerce over the Internet is projected to
jump from $48 billion in 1998 to $1.5 trillion by 2003, according to
Forrester Research Inc. During the same period, the research firm
estimates that consumer sales over the Internet will rise from $3.9
billion to $108 billion.

# Looking for Clues In the Service Sector

The service sector of the economy is where productivity gains appear
to have been especially sluggish and where experts are looking most
closely for evidence of an efficiency payoff from technology.

In Chicago, Michael Rushmore, a banker, said Internet computing has
&ldquo;fundamentally changed the way we do business&rdquo; over the last three
or four years. An example of this is the way corporate loans are
syndicated among many banks, said Mr. Rushmore, who is a managing
director of Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, the securities arm of
the BankAmerica Corporation.

Until about two years ago, syndicating a large corporate bank loan
meant distributing a lengthy offering document, often running more
than 200 pages, to 50 to 100 banks. It was, Mr. Rushmore recalled, a
nightmarish, inefficient process that involved waves of overnight
mail, constant faxing and armies of messengers.

Today, much of that process is handled over the Internet on bank Web
sites that other banks tap into to read and download the offering
document, ask questions and exchange views. Mr. Rushmore estimates
that the Internet-based system trims 25 percent from the time it takes
to close a deal, not just improving the ease of the transaction but
also saving an immense amount of work.

The rapid spread of Internet-based computing, experts say, promises to
compress the time it takes for any new technology to enhance economic
welfare in general. The classic study of the phenomenon, &ldquo;The Dynamo
and the Computer: An Historical Perspective on the Modern Productivity
Paradox,&rdquo; by Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford
University, was published in 1990.

The electric motor, Mr. David noted, was introduced in the early
1880&rsquo;s but did not generate discernible productivity gains until the
1920&rsquo;s. It took that long, he wrote, not only for the technology to be
widely diffused but also for businesses to reorganize work around the
industrial production line, the efficiency breakthrough of its day.

&ldquo;The process takes longer than people think, but I still believe that
we will get a revival of productivity growth led by the spread of
computing,&rdquo; Mr. David said.

# Techno-Pessimists See an &lsquo;Arms Race&rsquo;

His is a misplaced faith, according to the dwindling band of
techno-pessimists whose own beliefs remain unshaken. Sure, they
concede, there has been surprisingly strong productivity growth for
the last three years. Could this represent a break in the trend?
Possibly, they grudgingly admit, but only a tiny shift at best.

The real problem, they say, lies in the composition of the nation&rsquo;s
vast service economy. More than half of all white-collar workers are
what they term &ldquo;knowledge workers&rdquo; -- managers, executives and
professionals like doctors, lawyers, teachers, even economists.

&ldquo;The work they do does not lend itself to technology-driven
improvements in productivity, and any gains are really difficult to
eke out and are glacial,&rdquo; said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. &ldquo;Paul David&rsquo;s electrical motor has
nothing to do with the knowledge-intensive process of work in a
service economy.&rdquo;

A leading technology cynic at the Fed meeting tomorrow will be Paul
Strassmann, a former chief information officer of Xerox and the
Pentagon. Mr. Strassmann, author of &ldquo;The Squandered Computer,&rdquo;
published in 1997, believes that much of corporate America&rsquo;s spending
spree on information technology amounts to an &ldquo;economic arms race,&rdquo;
fueled by misguided management theories.

The recent improvement in productivity, according to Mr. Strassmann,
is mainly attributable to the lower cost of capital because of low
interest rates. His summary view, though at odds with those of
technology optimists like Mr. Brynjolfsson of M.I.T., may also be
received warmly by the Fed.

&ldquo;The explanation for the productivity improvement is interest rates,
not information technology,&rdquo; Mr. Strassmann said. &ldquo;The hero here is
not Bill Gates. It&rsquo;s Alan Greenspan.&rdquo;

Yet even Mr. Strassmann finds the technology undeniably useful, if not
a productivity elixir. When asked a detailed question, he replied:
&ldquo;Just look it up on my Web site. It&rsquo;s a lot more efficient that
way.&rdquo;
