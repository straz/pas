There are hopeful glimmers that the long-anticipated yet elusive
recovery in the information technology business may finally be coming
into view. Besides the recent surge in technology shares on Wall
Street are more substantive signs like the fact that orders for many
computer products and semiconductors are stabilizing and even
gradually gaining ground.

Yet many skeptics remain. And even if a recovery is indeed getting
under way, industry analysts say, it promises to be a pretty sober
affair -- slow and uneven. Instead of leading the economy, as it did
in the 1990's, the technology sector is being pulled along with it,
behaving more like other industries and less like a business that
operates by its own &ldquo;new economy&rdquo; rules.

And so it may be that Wall Street has gotten ahead of itself, acting
as if an old-fashioned tech rebound were under way. Stock prices on
the Nasdaq, where many technology companies are listed, are up roughly
30 percent since March 11. And the Standard & Poor's 500 Information
Technology Index is up about 50 percent since hitting a recent low
last October.

Perhaps the most significant reason to expect only a measured,
plodding recovery is the changed attitudes of, and new pressures on,
the corporate buyers of information technology -- computer hardware,
software and services -- whose purchasing habits largely control the
industry's fate.

Long gone is the irrational optimism of the 90's and the notion that
technology alone can transform a business. Today, corporate executives
regard technology as simply a tool -- though a crucial one, if used
wisely. But it is also a costly tool: Information technology accounts
for nearly 60 percent of all business equipment investment. So there
is plenty of incentive to restrain spending.

Technology is still a big corporate expense, but technology budgets
have flattened out, if not fallen, at most companies. That is a very
different world for senior corporate technology executives, often
called chief information officers, or C.I.O.'s, who for years became
accustomed to having their budgets rise by 10 to 20 percent annually.

&ldquo;C.I.O.'s, after years of being asked to do more with more, are being
asked in a serious way to do more with less,&rdquo; said Richard Hunter, a
research fellow at Gartner Inc., a technology research firm.

When it surveyed more than 600 C.I.O.'s worldwide earlier this year,
Gartner found that their top three goals, in order of importance, were
cutting costs, shoring up information security and supporting
innovation. &ldquo;It shows you how much pressure C.I.O.'s are under, when
cutting costs is No. 1 and supporting innovation is No. 3,&rdquo;
Mr. Hunter observed.

Corporate spending plans remain crimped. According to a survey in May
by CIO Magazine, corporate technology executives said on average that
they expected their purchases of information technology to increase by
just 3.3 percent over the next 12 months. Back in 2000, technology
executives projected increases of 15 to 20 percent in the magazine's
monthly surveys.

Even technology vendors that have thrived through the downturn, like
Microsoft, acknowledge the shift in attitudes among corporate
customers. In his yearly status report e-mailed to Microsoft's 54,000
employees earlier this month, Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive,
noted, &ldquo;As I talk to business customers, there is less passion and
enthusiasm for technology, and greater focus on doing more with
less.&rdquo;

And at a time when the faith in information technology may be
faltering, The Harvard Business Review has published an article
provocatively titled, &ldquo;IT Doesn't Matter.&rdquo; The essay, written by
Nicholas G. Carr, the former editor at large of The Business Review,
struck many industry executives as heresy when it appeared last
month. It argued that as computer technology becomes more
standardized, businesses will have a harder time gaining a competitive
edge over their rivals through technology investments.

The article has been widely read and discussed, and The Business
Review's mailbag has been filled with dissenting views (several are
published online, www.hbr.org, and a few will be published in the July
issue of the magazine).

But even the essay's critics scarcely make a case for a new technology
boom. Paul A. Strassmann, 74, is an elder statesman of the
C.I.O. fraternity, having held that title at General Foods, Kraft,
Xerox and the Department of Defense, and he remains an executive
adviser to NASA. Mr. Strassmann dismisses the Business Review article
as &ldquo;absolute poppycock&rdquo; because of the &ldquo;enormous unrealized
potential of information technology.&rdquo;

The potential is unrealized, according to Mr. Strassmann, mainly
because of two decades' worth of mindless technology spending through
the 1980's and 1990's. The spending spree, combined with exponential
improvements in processing speeds and data storage capacity, has meant
companies are often overwhelmed by computing firepower they cannot use
efficiently. &ldquo;It was not about economics or productivity,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It was a technology arms race.&rdquo;

Mr. Strassmann's prescription? &ldquo;It's better to slow down and master
the thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That's the nub of the problem.&rdquo;

Anthony E. Scott, the chief of technology for information services at
General Motors, also takes issue with Mr. Carr's article. &ldquo;He's right
that large parts of the industry are maturing,&rdquo; Mr. Scott said. &ldquo;But
there is still lots of room for innovation and to gain competitive
advantage from information technology.&rdquo;

Mr. Scott is part of the technology team at General Motors that years
ago began paring costs in ways that are now popular in corporate
America, like reducing the number of hardware and software products
used and consolidating data processing into fewer, larger computer
centers. In 1996, G.M. spent $4 billion on information technology. Its
budget for this year is just under $3 billion, and its plan calls for
further cuts next year.

Still, G.M. is investing in software applications and systems to
increase its use of the Internet and the Web to communicate more
closely with suppliers, dealers, industry partners and
customers. &ldquo;Despite the dot-bomb and a difficult economy,&rdquo; Mr. Scott
said, &ldquo;that Web-based work to expand our external connections
continues unabated.&rdquo;

Companies like Capital One, a large bank and credit card marketer that
is still expanding its information technology spending, are the
exceptions among technology buyers. Capital One is growing strongly
and its technology spending will rise 10 to 20 percent this year, said
Gregor Bailar, the company's chief information officer.

Capital One is renowned for its use of data mining and information
analysis techniques to find and reach particularly profitable slices
of the credit card market. The company, Mr. Bailar noted, has an
&ldquo;information-based strategy&rdquo; in which technology and business
considerations are deeply intertwined.

Like many C.I.O.'s, Mr. Bailar has read the recent Harvard Business
Review article. And he said that Mr. Carr, by writing it, had
performed &ldquo;a great service&rdquo; by stimulating debate about the role of
information technology. But Mr. Bailar said the article's flaw was in
discussing the maturity of information technology in terms of
industrial technologies like railroads, steam and the
telegraph. These, he noted, were single-purpose technologies, whereas
the computer is a programmable, general-purpose technology with all
but infinite possibilities.

The Business Review article, Mr. Bailar added, tended to treat
computer hardware and software as if mere transport vehicles for bits
-- short for binary digits -- the lingua franca of information
technology. &ldquo;The competitive advantage you gain from using
information technology is not based on storing or moving bits
around,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but based on what you do with them.&rdquo;

Besides, technology executives say, the shift to industry-standard
microprocessors and software building blocks does not mean a leveling
of the opportunities for using technology to gain an edge over
competitors.

Dell Computer, for example, has used industry-standard technology to
run its business. &ldquo;But Dell has used information technology to gain
an extraordinary competitive advantage in the personal computer
business, becoming superefficient because of its supply-chain
system,&rdquo; said Charles Fitzgerald, a strategy executive at Microsoft.

Mr. Carr, the author of the Harvard Business Review article,
acknowledged that technology, used cleverly, can still give companies
an edge in the marketplace. &ldquo;But my point is that the layer of
technology that is customizable, and therefore can give a company a
competitive advantage, is getting thinner and thinner,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And technology-based competitive gains won't last as long in
the future. I still think my conclusions are true.&rdquo;

Even a success story, like Dell, cuts both ways in the context of
looking for a technology recovery. The company's strong growth has
come largely through taking sales from its rivals -- not because of
solid growth in the personal computer industry in general.

The semiconductor industry, meanwhile, does appear to have begun a
gradual recovery. Earlier this month, the chip industry's two largest
contract manufacturers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and United
Microelectronics, reported that their monthly sales in May were the
strongest in more than two years. And the Semiconductor Industry
Association, in its most recent forecast, estimated that this year
should be one of recovery, with sales up about 10 percent, compared
with last year.

But the semiconductor trade group added that its forecast through 2006
reflected &ldquo;the new realities of the semiconductor industry,&rdquo; with
expectations of average yearly growth of 8 to 10 percent. That
compares with an average annual rate of 17 percent going back more
than two decades.

&ldquo;The industry is maturing -- that is the view that everyone is coming
to share,&rdquo; said Kevin Krewell, a senior editor of Microprocessor
Report.

The nature of that maturation is a subject of debate, both in the
industry and on Wall Street. The long-term trend, going back to the
1960's, is that spending on information technology grows at two to
three times the rate of growth of the economy.

Investors seem to assume that a rebound to that historical rate is
certain and probably right around the corner, even though corporate
buying remains weak. &ldquo;Right now there is a disconnect between the
run-up in tech stocks and the technology spending expectations of
C.I.O.'s,&rdquo; said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at
Prudential Securities.

Technology stocks are valued as the corporate residents of a growth
industry. The 100 companies in the Merrill Lynch technology index are
priced at 29 times analysts' projected earnings for 2004, compared
with 16 times for the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

Some analysts say the technology stock investors may be on the right
track. &ldquo;There's a tremendous divergence of opinion and many of my
peers think this is a false start,&rdquo; said Richard Whittington, a
semiconductor analyst at American Technology Research. &ldquo;But I think
this is going to broaden out, and we're seeing the start of a real
recovery.&rdquo;

But Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, argued that the
current rally might be short-lived without more solid evidence of
stronger technology spending. Asked to explain the recent market
rally, Mr. Milunovich observed, &ldquo;There is still a bit of romance
about technology.&rdquo;
