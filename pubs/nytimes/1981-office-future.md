NEW YORKâ€” People who instinctively resist the idea of working around
word processors, computer terminals and other paraphernalia of what
has come to be known as the office of the future may be sharply
narrowing their job opportunities.

&ldquo;The structure of America is changing, and the future of American
productivity is increasing work opportunities for the white-collar
work force,&rdquo; said Paul Strassmann, vice president of strategic
planning for the Xerox Corporation&rsquo;s information products group. &ldquo;As
a result, information industries will move into a position of economic
dominance. It will be as exciting a place to be as railroads in the
1890&rsquo;s and automobiles in the 1920&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s.&rdquo;

Sales and senior service employees in computer manufacturing and
service companies are expected to earn $65,000 to $100,000, after
inflation, in 1990. Moreover, people skilled in computer technology
and computer applications will have greater freedom in picking an
employer, geographic location and work proj ec ts than most of those
who shun the computer.

In a study completed earlier this year, the American Electronics
Association concluded that the electronics industry alone could hire
nearly 200,000 college graduates with electronics engineering and
computer science degrees through 1985. But given current and projected
enrollments, only a third of the new graduates needed, or about
70,000, are expected to be available in the next four years. The
shortag e in filling jobs produced by the information revolutionis not
limite d to engineers. According to the Labor Department&rsquo;s Bureau of
Lab or Statistics, the demand for mechanics to service dataprocessing
machines will nearly triple by 1990, to as many as 172,000.

Bidding wars for experts in circuitry design and other electronics
specialties have pushed salaries beyond $100,000 within major computer
manufacturing houses. And executive recruiters have found computer
specialists among the easiest to place because of the extreme
shortage.

With prices plummeting and new, automated office equipment being
brought forth with widening applications, companies embracing the
concept of the office the future are looking for people expert in the
various hardware and programs. And many of them are especially
searching for people who understand the business the technology
serves, as well as the technology itself.

Among office clerical workers, the ability to work with wordprocessing
equipment is becoming more essential, according to Alan R. Schonberg,
president of Management Recruiters International Inc., a large
recruiting concern based in Cleveland. In turn, he said, that skill
will enable clerical workers to take on more responsibilities with
higher pay as more tasks are consigned to the information systems.

The ease with which aspiring managers can manipulate computer-based
information is increasingly regarded as a critical element in their
ability to move higher on the organization ladder.

&ldquo;There is increasing need for an awareness of how to deal with
computers in simple tasks today,&rdquo; Mr. Schonberg said. &ldquo;In company
after company, whether or not they have been using computers to make
management decisions in the past, more and more are adopting the use
of minicomputers today.&rdquo;

Major manufacturers in the information industry, such as the
Hewlett-Packard Company, Texas Instruments, Wang Laboratories and the
International Business Machines Corporation, will account for
approximately 15 percent of the nation&rsquo;s total annual output of goods
and services this year. Mr. Strassmann, the Xerox executive, believes
the figure could top 30 percent in the early 1990&rsquo;s.

According to Xerox estimates, more than 60 million workers, of a total
American work force of approximately 110 million, will be linked to
what it calls electronic &ldquo;work stations&rdquo; by 1990. The office
automation industry is expected to ship from 1.5 million to 2 million
work stations this year, and annual production should surpass 5
million units a year by 1990.

&ldquo;You have 36 million people who will need computer literacy skills,&rdquo;
Mr. Strassmann said. &ldquo;They will all have to come to live with the
work station - their 'electronic slave&rsquo; - in the same way that America
had to become automobile literate after the 1920&rsquo;s. That took 30 years
to absorb. By and large, their training will come from their
employers.&rdquo;

Mr. Strassmann said that a new employee &ldquo;had better come to the job
with more computer know-how,&rdquo; regardless of career aspirations. This
is true as well, he said, for bank executives, lawyers, college
professors and middle and senior managers in corporations.

Few senior executives have that training and they are often frustrated
with their data-processing departments. Victor E. Millar, the partner
in charge of management information consulting services at Arthur
Andersen & Company, the accounting concern, said there was great
demand for people who understood both the technology and the
information needs of a business.

&ldquo;Many data-processing people are concerned with getting their system
up and running, not how well the user of the system understands what
will happen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On the other hand, the manager doesn&rsquo;t
clearly understand what the system is going to deliver, or how much
time and energy he&rsquo;ll have to personally spend with it. It&rsquo;s a common
problem.&rdquo;

Being qualified for a career in designing or implementing office
automation technology, according to Mr. Strassman, means in part being
fluent in at least two or three computer languages, as well as an
understanding of the technology of telecommunications - how data is
transmitted over telephone lines or via satellite.

&ldquo;You will have to understand radio, satellites, television
transmission, cable and so forth,&rdquo; Mr. Strassman said, &ldquo;if you want
to be in a position to have computing machines talk to other machines,
talk to human beings or how human beings talk with the machines.&rdquo;

A solid grounding in mathematics and science courses in college will
also be a necessity for those who aspire to jobs as managers of
computer systems. &ldquo;Without it, you will be debilitated in your
career,&rdquo; Mr. Strassmann said. &ldquo;And, remember, we are
talking about a career in fields that will span to the year 2040 or
more for people entering college today.&rdquo; That message has not
been unheeded in Mr. Strassmann&rsquo;s household. Three of his four
children are now engaged in university studies in fields related to
information industries. One is in a doctoral program in occupational
statistics and health, another is working for a master&rsquo;s degree
in computer-simulated decision-making in organizations and the third
is embarking on an undergraduate specialty in computer-science.

The youngest Strassman, who entered Harvard this month, is president
of his own computer company, which sells programs to teachers of high
school physics courses.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m like that uncle in 'The Graduate&rsquo; who comes over to Dustin
Hoffman and whispers, 'Plastics,&rsquo; &rdquo; said the elder
Strassmann. &ldquo;Except I say, 'Information industries.&rsquo; &rdquo;
