<h2>The Meaning of Value Gets a Fresh Definition</h2>

With the understanding that it's not the willy-nilly
application of information technology but its proper management that encourages
productivity comes a new emphasis on economic profit or, as it is known today,
economic value added (EVA).<p>

The question, "What is value?" has plagued scholars as far back as the 14th
century. Twenty-first
century consultants like Paul Strassmann, of New Canaan, Conn., are applying
basic economic concepts of value to their understanding of what makes IT pay.<p>
In a nutshell, here's how Strassmann calculates value added. By delving into
the innards of annual reports, Strassmann winnows down revenues. First he
subtracts the cost of purchased goods, energy and services, as well as interest
costs and taxes. Then he subtracts shareholder value added, operations costs
and management costs. What's left over is management value added.<p>
Strassmann calls the ratio of management value added to management costs
"return on management," or R-O-M(TM)
(not to be confused with read only memory).<p>

Why is R-O-M important? Because return on equity, return on assets and every other
traditional financial metric ever studied have failed to yield a positive
correlation between business performance and IT investment, says Strassmann.
And that gave rise to the productivity paradox; nobody could tell why some
companies succeed, with IT investments yielding revenue growth, and other
companies fail. R-O-M
is the only statistic Strassmann tested that has shown a positive relationship
to IT spending.<p>

But doing value-added
analysis on your company can be a bit like a painful visit to the doctor. If
your company is ill, there may be tough medicine to swallow. Nonetheless, such
Fortune 1000 companies as Coca-Cola,
Harnischfeger Industries, AT&amp;T and Quaker Oats are using EVA metrics now.
And a few of them are even tying executive compensation to the data.<p>
