In his <a href="http://www.strassmann.com/iep/squandered.html">latest
book</a>, Paul Strassmann asserts that "the era of exuberant business
spending for computers will end in the next decade." That shift, if it
comes to pass, has major implications for IT as CIOs will come under
added pressure to prove the value of IT investments. More than ever
before, companies will need to document the value of IT.<p>

Essentially a collection of essays, this book isn't intended as a
step-by-step guide for plotting alignment or assessing value. Rather,
Strassmann provides readers with cautionary tales of what works and
what doesn't. With ample case studies and numerous horror stories, he
succeeds in his mission.<p>

In Strassmann's view (and that of other experts he cites), value is a
direct product of aligning IT with business. Just what does Strassmann mean
by alignment? Forget about productivity, improved customer satisfaction and
quality; the way to measure IT's alignment with business goals is to gauge
IT's impact on the one metric that matters most to CEOs and shareholders:
net cash flow. In other words, alignment comes down to accounting, pure and
simple.<p>

In an era when business books seem to contain a lot of fluff, Strassmann is
refreshingly blunt. Never one to mince words, he offers his take on why IT
continues to lag behind the expectations and, in many cases, the basic
requirements of business. Among the topics Strassmann dissects are
outsourcing, alignment and evaluation methods.<p>

The section exploring residual value will be of particular interest to
CIOs. Strassmann covers a lot of ground, including the economics of
open systems, the merits of outsourcing and the failure of leadership.
For those who like to crunch numbers, the section on evaluation
methods explains several options for estimating computer budgets and
putting a value on computer assets.<p>

If the book has one fault, it's that some topics could benefit from more
detail. Yet maybe this is by design. The Squandered Computer is the first
book in a three-volume series on alignment. Unfortunately, Strassmann
advises readers to wait for the follow-up books before making definitive
plans for IT/business alignment. But with the speed of businesses heading
into overdrive these days, CIOs who wait may find themselves out of a job.<p>
