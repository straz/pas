<h3><a name="0">Opening Remarks:</a></h3>

 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, it is a privilege
to report to you on the current status of the Corporate Information
Management (CIM) initiative of the Department of Defense (DoD).<p>

     In terms of expense, the CIM initiative is the largest
information management program ever conceived by any U.S. business
organization. In terms of schedule, it will require every moment of
the 5-year period for which savings were initially targeted. CIM calls
for a major reengineering and restructuring of business methods and
administrative processes in DoD.<p>

The immediate CIM goals are set by the Defense Management Report (DMR)
initiatives. Each of the top three DMR cost reduction targets exceeds
the annual information management budgets for the top three U.S.
manufacturing companies. A significant percentage of DMR cost
reductions will be accomplished as a result of the CIM initiative. As
Mr. Andrews pointed out, we are now concentrating on improving
information management in selected administrative areas, such as
contract payment, civilian payroll, distribution centers, and medical
applications. We are also setting the foundation for applying CIM
information management methods to all other DoD business areas.<p>

We have chosen information technology as one of the tools to achieve
DMR results. Our objective is to shorten the time for delivery of new
computer applications by 75 percent while simultaneously realizing
savings in excess of $6.0 billion in information technology through
fiscal year 1997. This includes savings through reductions in systems
development costs, sharing of computer software, consolidation of
systems engineering design centers, and simplifying operations of data
and design centers. The information technology savings also include
gains from the Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (CALS)
initiative and the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) initiative for
paperless processing of business transactions.<p>

Let me emphasize, however, that CIM should not be seen as an
information technology program. Although it is expected to deliver in
excess of $6.0 billion of savings in information technology, CIM
succeeds only insofar as it supports all DMR targets. Information
technology should be seen only as the rails on which the DMR freight
train can roll to deliver its results!<p>

Even the most ambitious initiatives can succeed only by making steady
progress, one step at a time. Therefore, I shall dispense with
generalities and concentrate on examples of what CIM has already
accomplished. After that, I shall discuss immediate steps we are
taking to make sure CIM ultimately delivers what is expected.<p>

<h3><a name="A">A. Illustrative Examples Of CIM Results:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="A1">1. Theater Medical Automation</a></h4>

The start of Operation Desert Shield found the Department without the
necessary medical information system capabilities to support a major
joint theater operation. The medical functional group provided joint
automation support for Desert Storm. This included the Theater Army
Medical Management Information System, Defense Medical Regulating
Information System, and Automated Patient Evacuation System. Each of
these systems had to be adapted to function as an integral part of a
joint theater medical operation.<p>

The four Services began immediate implementation of required support.
By November 1990, essential automation support was being provided to
medical regulating, patient administration, patient evacuation, and
medical logistics operations. By the start of Operation Desert Storm,
this support was being provided from the Central Command theater of
operations, through Europe, and into the support base in the
continental United States. Throughout the Operation, the medical group
worked closely with the Joint Staff, both theater commands, and the
Services to provide the necessary support.<p>

By April 1991, these automation initiatives supported 10,000 patients
and tracked the movement of over $200 million in medical supplies in
theater. In providing this support, time for a patient regulating
request was reduced from 20 minutes to 30 seconds.<p>

Altogether, twelve standard systems have been designated to serve
medical information-handling needs of DoD Components.

<h4><a name="A2">2. Logistic Systems</a></h4>


We have selected a number of current, wholesale logistic systems as
candidate DoD standards. In the future, we anticipate the functional
requirements represented by a large number of existing information
systems in the materiel management area will be met by fewer
redesigned systems. This will require considerable additional planning
and analysis, but we expect substantial returns.

<h4><a name="A3">3. Civilian Personnel Systems</a></h4>

For the civilian personnel function, we have selected a single system
- the Air Force Civilian Personnel Data System - to support 94 percent
of DoD employees.

<h4><a name="A4">4. Financial Operations Systems</a></h4>

The CIM process is instrumental in enabling the Defense Finance and
Accounting Service (DFAS) to consolidate diverse financial operations.
DFAS is now working jointly with the civilian payroll group to specify
how the DoD payroll business shall be conducted.<p>

The CIM functional groups are currently evaluating Army's travel
module for deployment by the Air Force and are also evaluating the
potential of adopting Army's Program and Budget System for deployment
by the Defense Logistics Agency (OLA) and the Air Force.<p>

The subcommittee should be aware that unification and consolidation of
administrative systems is not a simple technical matter. For instance,
the civilian payroll group has identified many procedural differences
in current business practices among DoD Components;<p>

<ul>
<li>how to calculate pay after expiration of a temporary, appointment;

<li>how to deliver leave and earning statements (mailing versus hand-delivery);

<li>how to document time and attendance and labor accounting
(extensions computed in the payroll system versus outside the payroll
system;

<li>how to address payment versus use of compensatory time; and

<li>how to define a standard pay period. (The Military Departments use
the same pay period and DLA uses an alternate pay period.)

</ul>

The above may appear to be minor procedural matters. However,
accumulation of such diversity makes it mandatory to change business
practices and reorient people prior to attempting a systems
consolidation that has a chance of succeeding.<p>

Precipitous consolidations without consideration of human and
procedural complexities have resulted in well documented
administrative disasters. We shall avoid taking such risks. We shall
specify improved business methods before proceeding with any
standardization.  

<h3><a name="B">B. Measures to Assure CIM Program Results:</a></h3>

<h4><a name="B1">1. Measurement of Effectiveness And Efficiency</a></h4>

The Department is now installing an aggressive approach to measure
effectiveness of individual CIM initiatives. In each case, we shall
ask for expected financial results and for operating measures prior to
approving full implementation. The program manager will show expected
cash flow, adjusted for risk and for the time value of money. This
approach follows industrial practices of business analysis in
justifying productivity improvement projects.

To make comparisons between different implementation alternatives, we
have delivered to the Contract Payment CIM group a computerized
procedure for financial evaluations. This approach will assure
consistency of planning, provide a method for full disclosure of
operating assumptions, and allow for quarterly audit of actual
accomplishments.<p>

We require CIM program managers to compare their projected unit costs,
order-handling delays, and transaction errors with comparable private
sector business practices. For example, in the case of handling
purchase orders for low cost items, the Materiel Management CIM
manager will examine purchasing practices of the most efficient U.S.
firms. The CIM method requires performing value-engineering on
individual transactions to find out how to revise existing DoD
business policies and practices.<p>

We expect most of the projected CIM savings will result from change in
business methods and revision in DoD policies rather than from more
efficient computerization. There is no point in having a computer do
something faster if it should not be done at all!

<h4><a name="B2">2. Measuring Results of The CIM Progam</a></h4>


Timely delivery of cost reductions specified in the Defense Management
Report initiatives - without impairing effectiveness of our Armed
Forces - shall be used as the proof that the CIM program is effective.
We have decided to couple CIM activities to implementation of DMR
initiatives. The CIM approach to streamlining all DoD business methods
and eliminating unnecessary information activities becomes the means
for delivering the initiatives' results. This is why the scope of CIM
covers streamlining of all DoD information work, which includes
personnel, materiel, logistics, finance, and planning.

<h4><a name="B3">3. Role of Computers In CIM</a></h4>

A relatively small share of total DMR savings will accrue from
simplification and standardization of information technology. Benefits
from streamlining DoD's automatic data processing activities will
become visible as we monitor results from technology programs Just as
we track all other CIM programs.<p>

Improvements in responsiveness of organizations managing computers are
essential for achieving CIM cost reduction targets while improving
effectiveness of defense support operations.

<h4><a name="B4">4. Measuring Value of Information</a></h4>

Analysts studying the competitiveness of U.S. industry discovered a
prevailing neglect in managing "indirect" costs, also identified as
"overhead" expenditures. The value of a tank, fighter airplane, or
cruiser can be evaluated, because they represent tangible military
power. The value of information-handling procedures is much harder to
assess, because these costs are incurred on the basis of custom,
procedure, regulation, and organization.<p>

Industry has attacked the problem of overhead cost control through
"activity-ba sed" accounting. In this approach, indirect support costs
are attributed to operating results.<p>

We have embarked on a vigorous program to associate overhead support
activities with tangible operating results. The first target for the
new approach is information technology. Information services provided
by large DoD data and software design centers will be placed on a
fee-for-service basis. Data center and design center budgets will be
determined by demand from DoD customers and not by budget allocation
which cannot achieve a fair balance between supply and demand for
information services.<p>

Since the electronic industry delivers annual cost/performance
improvements in the 30 to 40 percent range, adoption of
fee-for-service is a prerequisite for an economically sound approach
to the expected modernization of computer centers that the CIM program
requires. Fee-for-service makes it possible to establish a measure of
actual computer center productivity gains.<p>

Similarly, marked productivity gains that can be achieved by means of
Computer-aided Systems Engineering (CASE) methods will permit
evaluation of options for delivering software support to DoD
Components. Fee-for-service for design centers will make it possible
to establish a measure of competitive excellence for software
efforts.<p>

<h4><a name="B5">5. Data Management</a></h4>

For CIM to succeed, we shall eliminate unnecessary labor in
transcribing, translating and reinterpreting the same data. Penalties
for inconsistent and redundant handling of data are incurred primarily
by clerical and administrative personnel. Poor data management
practices show up as costly errors in the conduct of DoD business
affairs, as excessive transaction costs, and as added management
layers to monitor and control work. <p>

The Executive Level Group stated all data in DoD should be entered
into the information-handling system only once, with zero defects, so
it could be reused as the information passes from its origin to its
final use.<p>

All DoD data definitions are now a shared "joint" asset, rather than
belonging to individual information-handling systems. Data modeling
and data control shall be under direct policy guidance of the office
of the Director of Defense Information.<p>

The subcommittee may be also interested to hear that we are not
viewing CIM's data management program as an isolated DoD activity.<p>

We are in the final process of reaching an agreement with the Veterans
Administration on their participation in data sharing aspects of the
CIM program. They have identified information management savings if
they can make direct use of DoD personnel and medical information when
veterans transfer from DoD to the Veterans Administration.<p>

DoD suppliers will also be affected by our Computer-aided Acquisition
and Logistics Support (CALS) CIM initiative. CALS addresses timely and
efficient handling of information that supports weapons and commercial
products acquired by the DoD. Our purpose is to improve productivity
within DoD as well as reduce the paperwork required of our suppliers.
For instance, we developed methods and standards for electronic
transmission of engineering drawings, technical manuals, and
manufacturing documentation.

<h4><a name="B6">6. Speeding Up And Reducing Costs of Information Technology Implementation Through Standards</a></h4>

To simplify DoD business methods, we shall substitute automation for
labor-intensive and error prone procedures whenever economically
justifiable. The urgency of DMR targets makes it necessary to install
new information technology on a schedule measured in months instead
of years.<p>

In June, I shall be joined by information technology executives from
all DoD Components to announce DoD's unqualified commitment to
implement a standard, vendor-independent, and readily upgradable
information systems architecture. This approach is generally known as
the pursuit of "open systems" architecture.<p>

No major U.S. corporation has as yet made such a full commitment,
because "open systems" architecture is still debated in public,
private, national, and international standards organizations. DoD
cannot wait for vendors and customers to reach full agreement on every
computer systems standard.<p>

We shall proceed, without further delay, to construct all DoD
information systems according to approved Federal Standards, as
defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We
shall focus DoD resources on accelerated adoption of Federal
information Processing Standards (FIPS). We shall continue
participating in international and industry standard organizations,
after endorsement from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.<p>

All information standards activities in DoD shall be under central
coordination from the new Center for Information Management within the
Defense Communications Agency and guided by policy from the Director
of Defense Information.

<h4><a name="B7">7. Speeding Up And Reducing Costs of Information Technology Through Systems Engineering Tools</a></h4>

Prevailing methods for specification and development of new computer
applications are labor-intensive and extremely error prone. They
result in excessive life-cycle maintenance costs. At present, the
overwhelming majority of DoD programming resources is consumed in
maintaining computer programs handcrafted more than a decade ago.<p>

We shall select from a wide array of available tools a DoD standard
set that will be applied to the manufacture of all new computer
programs. Specification and selection of standard DoD software
production tools will be guided by central policy from the Director of
Defense Information. This approach will finally make it possible to
realize the original intent of specifying the ADA computer language as
a standard DoD programming language.<p>

Implications of adopting a standard set of software engineering tools
for DoD are far-reaching. The tools will safeguard interoperability of
computer applications nanufactured to the new standards. DOD's goal is
to apply the standard toolset to reengineering and reuse of existing
software. This will minimize conversion expenses while speeding up
full implementation of CIM programs.

<h4><a name="B8">8. Speeding Introduction of CIM Programs Through
Reduction Of Retraining Difficulties</a></h4>

Human factors - not information technology - are the pacesetters for
the rate of progress through application of CIM methods. Evolutionary
management methods and organizational learning will always be the most
important ingredients in reaching DMR goals.<p>

 CIM calls for changed work habits. Rapid changes expected under CIM
initiatives will require retraining of perhaps as many as one million
DoD employees. Training will have to be continuous and personalized,
because local conditions and individual skills will dictate the pace
of change.<p>

Information technology will play a major role as an ever present
tutor, available to every person whenever they need on-the-job
assistance. Existing information systems and information networks
possess a confusing variety in appearance, procedure, and in visual
perception. Therefore, they are not suitable as a means for
understanding what needs to be done.<p>

We shall proceed, as oart of adopting Federal Information Processing
Standards, to apply a standard graphic appearance to all new computer
screens to make them suitable as training aids.<p>

I thought members of the subcommittee would be particularly interested
to hear about these important behavioral dimensions of the CIM effort.
Management of the CIM program has been, is, and will always remain an
endeavor that depends on people for its achievement.  

<h4><a name="C">C. Concluding Remarks</a></h4>

Since 1955, I have managed many organizations in their quest to meet
challenges of the electronic age. Although nothing in my experience -
or anyone else's - compares with the scope and demanding schedule of
the CIM program, I am convinced that it shall succeed.<p>

Our objectives are clear. The human resources at our disposal are
equal or better than anything I have ever seen. The technical means
are available. The need has never been greater.<p>

As CIM evolves over the next several years, I am confident you will
be pleased when you examine evidence of what has been accomplished.
