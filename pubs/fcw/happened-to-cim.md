The Pentagon's Corporate Information Management (CIM) initiative
arrived with a bang in the early 1990s. The post-Cold War reduction in
military spending meant that the Defense Department had to make do
with less. CIM's answer was to trim costs and boost efficiency through
business process re-engineering. **Paul Strassmann**, who joined DOD in
1990 and was named director of defense information in 1991, led the
effort.

"CIM came about because Congress declared a peace dividend," said
Strassmann, now an information technology consultant. The CIM
objective was "don't cut troops, but streamline bureaucratic
processes," he continued. "I was brought in to have seven good years
to do it. Well, I didn't have seven good years. Everyone was counting
on a second [George H.W.] Bush administration."

Instead, Bill Clinton won the 1992 election and CIM was forgotten. Or was it?

"There have been a variety of transformation-oriented programs over
the past years, starting with CIM," said Michael Yoemans, who in the
early 1990s was the Pentagon's deputy director for business process
improvement. Yoemans is now director of strategic resource planning in
the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and
Information Integration.

CIM was succeeded by acquisition reform, the National Performance
Review and, most recently, the Pentagon's transformation initiative,
he said. "All have been on that same path, trying to deal with making
government a modern place to work," Yoemans said.

"Everybody tells me CIM is alive and kicking," Strassmann added.

So, CIM never really died. It just got a new name.
