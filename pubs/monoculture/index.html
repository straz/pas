The purpose of this article is to explain the risks arising from a Microsoft
software monoculture.
<p>&nbsp;The term "monoculture" is originally derived from agriculture.
It is the practice of growing the same crop each year on a given acreage.
Rotating crops helps control certain insects and diseases; farmers who
repeatedly grow the same crop on the same land become increasingly dependent
on chemical insecticides, and must resort to new disease-resistant plant
varieties, and practice soil fumigation and similar methods of controlling
insects and diseases that are usually controlled by crop rotation.&nbsp;
<p>If a large number of farmers, in proximate geography, adopt monoculture
practices, even the dependency on chemical means will not be sufficient
to protect the crops. Although the quantity of food is increased, the humans
create an environment that is hospitable to vermin, pathogens, and diseases.
Paradoxically, by increasing specialization monoculture farmers increase
the threats to their food supply.
<p>&nbsp;The potentially destructive, injurious and deadly characteristics
of monoculture practices are remarkably comparable to conditions one finds
prevailing in computer networks. Therefore, it may be useful first to examine
an agricultural case before venturing into an exploration of what it means
to have Microsoft software present in most of the computers in the world.

<br><img SRC="blame2b.gif" ALT="Agricultural Case: The Irish Potato Famine" height=24 width=260>
<p>&nbsp;The "Great Potato Famine" or the "Irish Famine" occurred in 1845-49
when the potato crop failed in successive years. The crop failures were
caused by blight that destroyed the potato plant. It was the worst famine
to occur in Europe in the 19th century. By the early 1840s, almost one-half
of the Irish population--but primarily the rural poor--had come to depend
almost exclusively on the potato for their diet, and the rest of the population
also consumed it in large quantities. A heavy reliance on just one or two
high-yielding varieties of potato greatly reduced the genetic variety that
ordinarily prevents the decimation of an entire crop by disease, and thus
made the Irish vulnerable. In 1845 a fungus arrived accidentally from North
America, and that same year Ireland had unusually cool, moist weather,
in which the blight thrived. About 1.1 million people died from starvation
or typhus and other famine-related diseases. Many emigrated, and by 1921
the population was barely half of what it had been in the early 1840s.

<br><img SRC="blame2c.gif" ALT="The Software Case: Microsoft's Dominance" height=24 width=260>
<p>&nbsp;Microsoft's dominance in operating systems represents a new threat
to the national security and to the systematic reliability of our computer-based
society.
<p>&nbsp;It is a fact that a large number of political institutions, both
in the U.S. and in other countries, are becoming increasingly aware of
the economic and security risks that arise from the ubiquitous presence
of Microsoft. The U.S. government as well as a European Economic Community
(EEC) Commission is trying to contain the expanding power of Microsoft
by litigation. This is insufficient. One must also address the risks from
attacks on a largely homogeneous systems management environment. Info-terrorists
and criminals will continue to take advantage of the ever-growing proliferation
of flaws in the gigantic Microsoft system, consisting of hundreds of millions
of lines of failure-prone code.
<p>&nbsp;The Microsoft software monoculture is dangerous because this firm
is pursuing its global expansion objectives with unconstrained ambition.
Its strength is reflected in its share of all profits from the software
business. That advantage has widened steadily from 24 percent in 1987 to
64 percent in 1998 and is likely to climb as Microsoft is expanding its
reach as a vendor of software packages to becoming a networking services
giant. In its recently announced .Net initiative, Microsoft has projected
a vision of a world that is inter-connected with Microsoft centers from
where each computer receives not only its operating software but also a
continuous stream of data and applications.&nbsp;
<p>Microsoft now sets its sights not only on the control of local computing
but also on the sources from which all program code and data originate.
Upgrading Microsoft software has been a logical choice for customers who
wished to keep up with changes in technology. The risks of an integrated
family of operating systems running all global computers, a declared Microsoft
objective, make selecting a Microsoft platform more than a purely technical
choice. An all-encompassing operating system bares itself to hostile exploitation
of paralyzing security flaws. The presence of a fatal defect is unavoidable
as the complexity of Microsoft systems expands to bizarre proportions with
each new release. It is the search for such a fault that occupies the minds
of some of the brightest computer experts. Finding a crack through which
one could induce mayhem with only a few keystrokes would be worth a great
deal of money, especially when supporting an act of terrorism.
<br><img SRC="blank.gif" height=45 width=100>
<br><img SRC="blame2d.gif" ALT="Microsoft and the Information Monoculture" height=24 width=400>
<p>&nbsp;It's only a question of time before the ubiquitous presence of
Microsoft operating systems, supported by a software-updating network,
reaches a level of interconnectivity that makes a universal systems crash
feasible.
<p>&nbsp;All that will be required is inducement of a widespread information
infrastructure collapse through a deliberately executed and pre-planned
act of information warfare. The risk from a software monoculture has increased
due to the shift from custom-made software to packaged applications residing
on an integrated family of Microsoft operating systems. As a result, the
risks from planned subversion of a software monoculture now overwhelm the
demonstrable benefits of standardization of an otherwise chaotic software
environment.&nbsp;
<p>The future of Microsoft should not be judged only by antitrust criteria
or the commercial merits of its software. It should be also reflected in
the unprecedented security risks to our civilization that a software monoculture
generates. The Microsoft defense that it was only maximizing profits using
common competitive methods is insufficient. Business practices that may
be tolerable for a small competitor become perilous whenever scaled up
to security-threatening proportions to global computer networks.&nbsp;
<p>Our computer-based information society is still in its early stages
of development. Its resilience and dependability is still not adequately
understood. If history teaches anything, it is the insight that monocultures
of any kind--especially if they can propagate in a matter of seconds--should
not be allowed to flourish without adequate safeguards.
