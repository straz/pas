<h2>IT ECONOMIST: PAUL STRASSMANN</h2>

<FONT SIZE=4><I>Drawing on his years as the head of information
systems at Kraft Foods, Xerox and the US Department of Defense, Paul
Strassmann is a renowned authority on IT productivity and return on
investment - issues that have come to dominate the agenda of many
organisations today.<P></I></FONT>

<B>Information Age (IA): When you served as Director of
Defense Information in the early 1990s, you presided over a $35
billion cost-cutting programme. Many chief information officers (CIOs)
today have to cut costs on a much smaller scale. How do you go about
identifying where to cut costs?</B><P>

Paul Strassmann (PS): Before placing the IT budget on the chopping
block, one must first identify and assess a firm's strategic strengths
and weaknesses relative to competition. I have always found that one
needs both to increase IT spending in some functions while
simultaneously cutting costs in others. Cuts should take place
wherever the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a business process is
demonstrably excessive. There are a variety of techniques for making
such a determination. I favour competitive benchmarking. For instance,
if the TCO of making millions of small purchases is greater than $100
per transaction (as was the DoD case), the entire process is placed on
the chopping list because the number should have been closer to $40
and possibly as low as $25.<P>

<B>IA: What kind of resistance can CIOs expect to face to when cost
cutting? Given that most CIOs have not had to cut costs before, what
advice can you give them?</B><P>

PS: Cost cutting is a means for altering the established
organisational power balance - by other means. It can be accomplished
by brute force, stealth or by legitimate means. How an organisation
regulates what I call the 'governance' of budgeting is an issue that
determines whether the cuts will result in intramural 'civil wars' or
in an orderly process for adjudicating business priorities. My best
advice to a CIO is to devote a great deal of time making sure that the
costcutting process is legitimate and that there is a well understood
'due process' for resolving differences as to what is important and
what is not.<P>

<B>IA: In your experience, do most CIOs have the experience or the
authority to do this? Or does another senior officer - the CEO or COO
- usually have to drive this?</B><P>

PS: The issue of appropriate authority to make decisions becomes
the core of what I refer to as governance. Authority must be
legitimised using established processes. In my case at the Department
of Defense, this derived entirely from directives known as DMRDs
(Defense Management Review Decisions), which had to be signed either
by the Secretary of Defense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense. The
DMRDs spelled out in detail specific authorities, including the
process for making budget adjustments.<P>

<B>IA: People talk about certain technologies, such as customer
relationship management (CRM), as having a strong return on investment
(ROI) case, while other technologies are more often described as being
'necessary' or even as providing 'long term competitive edge'. In your
experience, are there certain technologies that clearly pay for
themselves, and others that are much less likely to?</B><P>

PS: Technologies without strategic context are only toys. There
are no 'miracle drugs' that can be safely prescribed for all maladies.
CRM may be just what's needed in some cases, while it can create just
the opposite effect in different situations.<P>

<B>IA: You have sometimes been portrayed as an adversary to the
traditional CIO, because you advocate such tight budgetary control.
But you actually seem to be arguing for more power and authority, so
that he or she can drive strategy from the top.</B><P>

PS: I have been a consistent advocate for the CIO to leverage the
existing budgeting processes in order to legitimise what they propose
to accomplish. I am all in favour of cajoling the reluctant
bureaucrats with arguments about technological advantages. But every
rational argument must also be backed - as a last resort - with the
power of the purse, which is the source of all corporate power
anyway.<P>

<B>IA: Is it possible to make large cuts without losing the
competitive advantage that people expect from investing in information
technology? Is it possible to measure this?</B><P>

PS: There is no relationship whatsoever between IT spending and
competitive superiority. Competitive edge is gained almost always by
skillful focusing and balancing of all resources on what is critically
decisive. One can measure this by assessing a firm's Economic
Value-Added and, in the long run, by returns on shareholder equity. My
position is that most US corporations have over-invested in IT and are
long overdue to cut back on IT growth to restore sanity in information
management.<P>

<B>IA: According to the Gartner Group, IT spending as a percentage of
revenues will increase in every significant vertical sector between
2001 and 2005. At the moment, according to Gartner's calculations,
that stands at 2.89% of revenues in Europe, and will rise to 4.07%. Is
this a sign that Europe is repeating the mistakes of the US?</B><P>

PS: This forecast is nonsense. All you have to do is to run the
numbers to see if they pass the 'smell test'. Since EU revenues are
expected to grow at least 4% per year (this includes an allowance for
low inflation), projecting the IT spending from 2.89% to 4.07%
suggests that corporate IT budgets would increase 65%. As the prices
of information technologies are declining about 25% per annum, this
implies that EU firms would be actually purchasing 400% more IT
capacity!<P>

How that can be accomplished profitably is questionable.<P>

<B>IA: Almost every software salesperson is now armed with casebooks
and return on investment calculations. What is you opinion of these?
How should organisations engage with them?</B><P>

PS: Simply ask them to perform the identical calculations as they
would apply to your specific situation, in a manner which is both
verifiable and measurable.<P>

<B>IA: You have recently been talking about new analytic techniques
that can be used in justifying IT investments. Can you explain how
these techniques work?</B><P>

PS: My approach is to focus entirely on the risk-adjusted
discounted cash flow of a proposed investment strategy. The projected
revenue, profit and market share gains should be then locked into the
profit plan and into the executive bonus plan.<P>

<B>IA: Experience suggests that, even where rigorous ROI calculations
are carried out, they are not followed up after an investment has been
made. What systems can be put in place to help people to ensure that
ROI is monitored?</B><P>

PS: After an approved investment strategy is locked into the
operating as well as into the long range plan, the monitoring of
progress is then simply a matter of tracking operating variances
against budget on a monthly and quarterly basis.<P>

<B>IA: There is a trend towards linking payment to suppliers, in part
or whole, on the basis of the project meeting its business objectives.
Have you experience of these?</B><P>

PS: Yes, I favour the inclusion of escalating 'performance
bonuses' for performance that exceeds the contracted targets.<P>

<B>IA: Surely there are so many variables that this is a recipe for a
dispute. After all, there are usually at least three parties involved
(customer, integrator and product supplier), each ready to blame the
other for objectives not being met.</B><P>

PS: Performance bonus contracts must be bilateral to avoid
irresolvable three-sided disputes. Also, so far as I am concerned, the
product supplier should not be entitled to performance bonuses. For
product suppliers, conventional contracts, with warranties, should be
sufficient.<P>

<B>IA: Some researchers have suggested that as much as 40% of IT spending is 'off-budget'. This seems a lot. Should CIOs worry about this?</B><P>

PS: I have encountered the 40% 'stealth spending' factor several
times. The spending then shows up in other administrative overhead
accounts. This is why I have been advocating for years that if you
really wish to have a CIO then viewing his role only as a custodian of
the IT budget is a sham. A CIO must be accountable for information
spending, regardless of where it appears. <P>

<hr><p>

<I>Paul Strassmann is one of the true luminaries of global IT
management. Over a career that spans five decades, he has led
corporate information systems strategy at some of the world's largest
and most prestigious organisations.  In the 1960s, he was CIO of Kraft
Foods; in the 1970s, he directed worldwide information systems at
office systems giant Xerox; in the the 1990s, he took on the mammoth
task of managing the US Department of Defense's $10 billion IT budget;
and since then he has become a renowned and prolific lecturer,
consultant, adviser and writer on information management, IT
economics, 'information warfare', and productivity.<P>

That broad experience has given him deep insight into the changing
role of the CIO - especially when operating in a time of severe
budgetary constraints. At the Department of Defense (DoD), in
particular, Strassmann was made Director of Defense Information,
responsible for organising and managing the corporate information
management programme across the DoD, which included a $35 billion cost
reduction and business re-engineering programme of the defence
information infrastructure.<P>

At Xerox, he crossed the traditional boundaries of the CIO. Aside from
directing worldwide  computer,  telecommunications  and administrative
functions, Strassmann was part  of  the team that  shaped Xerox's move
beyond copiers and into general office automation systems. Pushing the
CIOs  skills  base  further,  he  took on responsibility  for  Xerox's
strategic  investments,  acquisitions   and  product   plans  for  the
company's electronic business.<P>

His experience has been distilled in scores of publications. His
Information Payoff The Transformation of Work in the Electronic Age is
now on its tenth edition, and other books - The Business Value of
Computers, The Politics of Information Management and The Squandered
Computer - focus on a recurring theme, and one that has never been
more pertinent: ensuring IT delivers an acceptable return on
investment.<P>

Today as president of The Information Economics Press, he lectures at
major universities and is called in as strategic advisor to scores of
multinational companies. But perhaps Strassmann's standing can be
summed in three phrases: 'Return-on Management', 'Information
Productivity' and 'Knowledge Capital' - phrases on which he holds the
US trademark.<P>
