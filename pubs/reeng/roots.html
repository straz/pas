<h2>The Roots Of<br>
Business Process Reengineering</h2>
<b>by Paul A. Strassmann<br><br>

<hr>

To grasp the full significance of any trend, one must gain an insight into the
forces that generated it. It is an easy simplification to attribute to
technology or to ideology the roles of &quot;causing&quot; historical development. Since
technology and ideology are presumed to be invented, they are like magic that
need no further explanation. As I see it, technology and ideology become
acceptable as result of changes in economic and social structure, and not the
other way around. <p>

The suddenly fashionable &quot;Business Process Reengineering,&quot; has been practiced
as a formal discipline since the early 1920's. Then it was known as &quot;Methods
and Procedures Analysis,&quot; always searching for new ways of restructuring work
flows or improving business organization. Why then reinvent now as something
new that had been around for at least 70 years? To answer that we must search
for deeper causes.

<h3><a name="RTFToC2">Dismal Economic Performance</a></h3>

American industrial corporations<a href="footnotes.html#fn1">[1]</a> have been detracting from the
creation of wealth since the 1970's. I can assert that because I do not look at
sales growth, sales/employee or accounting profits as a proof of favorable
results. I examine financial statistics in terms of the recently popularized
<i>Economic Value-Added{<font size="-2">TM</font>}</i>  (EVA) which is approximately 
the same as<i>Management Value-Added</i><a href="footnotes.html#fn2">[2]</a>. EVA can be defined<i> </i>as
the net contribution that remains after subtracting from profit-after-taxes the
cost of capital employed in a business.<a href="footnotes.html#fn3">[3]</a> In other words, the contribution
of management of a corporation can be measured better by subtracting from
accounting net profits an implied rent (cost of capital) on what shareholders
have contributed. <p>
In 85.3% of U.S. industrial corporation this <i>Management Value-Added</i><a href="footnotes.html#fn4">[4]</a> is greater than the cost of
capital. <p>
<p>
Therefore, the efficiency of management (<i>Management Value-Added</i> divided
by <i>Management Costs</i>)  instead of the efficiency of capital (<i>Net
Profits</i> divided by <i>CapitalCosts</i>) will be focus of our attention.

<h3><a name="RTFToC3">What Is The Problem?</a></h3>

The fundamental reality of the contemporary industrial scene is the revelation
that the management of most U.S. corporations are not creating wealth. The sum
total of their <i>Economic Value-Added</i> is negative. The following table
shows the arithmetic sum of EVA values for 1,000 U.S. industrial corporations
(in current year $ millions)<a href="footnotes.html#fn5">[5]</a>:<p>


<pre>
  1985     1986     1987     1988     1989     1990      1991     1992     1993  
  ----     ----     ----     ----     ----     ----      ----     ----     ----
-56,970  -39,661  -28,567  -27,761  -33,916  -64,733  -124,293  -98,864  -76,805  


</pre>
The
improvement in the <i>Economic Value-Added</i> noted in the period from 1991
through 1993 reflects the lowered costs of capital, as interest rates declined,
rather than a remarkable turnaround as result of re-engineering or cost
cutting.<a href="footnotes.html#fn6">[6]</a> The negative economic
performance is the result of an unfavorable spread between the current year
weighted average<i>Return-on-Capital</i> and the current year weighted
average<i>Cost-of-Capital</i>, as shown in the following table:<p>


<pre>
                    1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993   
                    ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
Return on Capital    9.6   8.5  10.1  10.8  10.2   9.2   6.5   7.2   7.3                                                                               
Cost of Capital     13.8  11.1  11.9  12.3  11.8  12.0  11.6  11.0  10.1   

</pre>
These
averages do not adequately portray the full dimensions of adversity. In 1993
there were 54.3% firms that produced negative Economic Value-Added:<a href="footnotes.html#fn7">[7]</a><p>
<img SRC="fig1.gif" WIDTH="445" HEIGHT="301"><p>
<p>
Is this situation likely to improve? I do not think that the prospects are very
good. The second half of 1994 and the start of 1995 have seen a rise in
interest rates and a decline in the value of the dollar, which means that even
startling improvements in operating performance will may not be sufficient to
immediately counteract an increasingly adverse economic climate.

<h3><a name="RTFToC4">Where Is The Problem?</a></h3>

The overall negative performance is not equally distributed throughout U.S.
industry. It is concentrated where business process re-engineering has found an
especially favorable climate, namely in car and truck manufacturing, metals
(steel and aluminum), computers and in telephone companies, as shown in the
following table:

Particularly noteworthy is the deteriorating performance of information
industries that are supposed to enjoy the benefits of rising productivity from
information technologies, and who are the most information-intensive examples
in the shift of U.S. investment capital from plant and equipment to information
capital.<a href="footnotes.html#fn8">[8]</a> <p>
<img SRC="fig2.gif" WIDTH="506" HEIGHT="315"><p>
<p>
The <i>Computer &amp; Peripherals</i> as well as the <i>Telephone</i> sectors,
once money-makers, are now major detractors from overall economic performance.
<i>Computer Software and Services</i> have improved, but their overall effect
is negligible.<p>
The rapidly deteriorating economic performance since 1990 was significantly
influenced by the poor performance<a href="footnotes.html#fn9">[9]</a> of the car and trucking industry
(especially General Motors), the large losses in the computer and telephone
industry (especially IBM and AT&amp;T) and huge losses in the airline industry
- perhaps the most highly computerized business as measured by the ratio of
computer terminals to employees.<p>
So, given all of the bad news, why then the sudden plunge into business process
reengineering since 1992 as the remedy for chronic ills that have been
developing for several decades?

<h3><a name="RTFToC5">Trends In Management Productivity</a></h3>

<h4><a name="RTFToC6">The Rise In Expectations</a></h4>

What is really new is the growing disparity between actual and expected
economic performance, as expressed by the difference in gains between the
<i>Economic Value-Added</i> and the sum of market values for shares for
industrial corporations. The market price of a share of a corporation reflects
investor expectations about prospective future increases in the <i>Economic
Value-Added</i>. The total market valuation for industrial corporations gives
us a good indication of what investors expect corporate management to deliver
ultimately:<p>
<p>
<img SRC="fig3.gif" WIDTH="488" HEIGHT="352"><p>
The market value (in current dollars) of U.S. industrial corporations has more
than doubled since 1985, while the <i>Economic Value-Added</i>, the engine of
value-creation, has remained not only stagnant, but negative throughout this
period. <p>
The rising expectations of the shareholders are also reflected in the steady
increases in the capital employed, which comes mostly from retained earnings
because corporations pay out as dividends only about a third of their
accounting profits. Only optimistic shareholders would leave a large part of
profits in the hands of management to invest in anticipation of superior
profits.<p>
What you see here is an inconsistency between reality and hope. Whenever such
chronic condition persist in human affairs, one can expect a rise in anxiety
and frustration. This often culminates in precipitous actions seeking rapid
relief. Business executives responded to the increasing pressure for
performance by embracing &quot;reengineering&quot; as the the cure that suddenly gave
legitimacy to shocking organizations into adoption of drastic remedial
measures. <p>
After years of listening to academics, consultants and management gurus
preaching about individual empowerment, teamwork, partnership, participative
management, knowledge-driven enterprises, learning organizations,
self-actualization, employee gain-sharing, common bonds, people-oriented
leadership, fellow-worker trust and long-term career commitment, the aggressive
language offered by the originators of reengineering seemed to offer welcome
relief.<a href="footnotes.html#fn10">[10]</a> 

<h3><a name="RTFToC7">Implications For Business Process Re-Engineering</a></h3>

The phenomenal acceptance of the concept of reengineering that took place
shortly after the appearance of Hammer and Champy's <i>Reengineering the
Corporation</i> only two years ago is a reflection of the current state of
frustration with business results. Nothing in that book is new or what has not
been said before about simplifying the flow of information or streamling
organizational relationships, except that suddenly everyone was ready to listen
to an old tune with a new sense of urgency. What was different in the
reengineering movement was its insistence on radical change and in advocacy of
extreme measures to bring about much desired reforms.<a href="footnotes.html#fn11">[11]</a><p>

Reengineering is certainly not a breakthrough in management thinking, but a
convenient bandwagon on which management and consultants could readily hop in
search of a quick remedy to unfavorable financial health of U.S. industrial
corporations that had been festering for a long time. A wholesome by-product of
this rush is the long overdue reinstatement of the primacy of business process
analysis that was neglected during three decades of over-emphasis on computer
systems and prior to that two decades of socio-psychological experimentation.
It has also freed funds for innovative computer-aided business analysis tools
which make business process improvement and systems analysis much easier to
do.<a href="footnotes.html#fn12">[12]</a><p>

It remains to be seen whether massive doses of Business Process Re-engineering
(BPR) will show up as lasting gains in economic value. My guess is that BPR
will soon give way to some new buzzword that will re-package a collection of
long proven management techniques that will apply to value-creation, gaining
market share, improving international competitiveness, boosting the value of
the dollar, improving employee morale, stimulating innovation, improving
government efficiency and enhancing managerial effectiveness. In fact, such
strategies are already being applied by a number of government and private
sector organizations successfully without the fanfare associated with BPR. <p>
If BPR is continued in its current state as primarily as battlefield
amputation, a permanent tourniquet or a public relations ploy by takeover
executives of companies that had already frittered away their customer
franchise, it will be remembered as just another of many other failed
infatuations.<p>
