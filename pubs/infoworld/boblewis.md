The question of whether computers do or do not demonstrably improve
productivity has stirred up a debate that has been on the agenda of
academics, the press, and consultants since the early 1970s.  Finally,
the winner of the 1987 Nobel prize in economics, Robert Solow, a
professor at MIT, obliged by giving these debates popular recognition
by tagging the lack of such evidence the "productivity paradox."

According to professor Solow, "You can see computers everywhere but in the productivity statistics."

The productivity paradox has not been resolved even to this day.  Our
highest economic authority, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve, chaired by Alan Greenspan, could not obtain a consensus on
this issue from the 10 most distinguished specialists in this field
after listening to their evidence for over four hours on April 15.

The debates about the productivity paradox range from strongly held
biases and self-serving claims, to misused statistics, to facts.  My
own work, which is based entirely on verified, validated, and audited
corporate data, has been involved in such discussions.  Therefore, the
credibility of my work depends entirely on the reliability and
trustworthiness of whatever I have written.

This is where InfoWorld columnist Bob Lewis enters into the picture.
With his Dec. 15, 1997, IS Survival Guide column, Lewis initiated a
campaign of attacks on my work.  (See "Computer backlash picks up
speed, but arguments from critics are flawed," <a
href="http://www.infoworld.com/printlinks">www.infoworld.com/printlinks</a>.)
The attacks continued in several columns.  My purpose here is to
counter those attacks.

For openers, in discussing my new book, The Squandered Computer, Lewis
wrote, " ... every big lie requires a big liar ... ." Lewis appears to
have based this characterization on the belief that I use the ratio of
Sales, General and Administrative over Cost of Goods Sold (SG&A/COG)
as a measure of IT value in the book.  His conclusions, and thus the
characterization, were in error on two counts.  First, my book does
not state anywhere that SG&A/COG is a measure of IT value.  Second, my
book does not refer to the SG&A/COG ratio as an indicator.

Following publication of my letter to the editor disputing Lewis&rsquo;
false representations, he countered in a subsequent column with a
number of statements, including one demonstrably incorrect allegation
that " ...  Strassmann ... has not talked to people who actually use
computers to do their jobs ... ."  (The letter and columns can be
found at <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/printlinks">www.infoworld.com/printlinks</a>.)

To press his criticism further, Mr. Lewis embarked on tampering with
my published statistics.  He singled out one of my many graphics,
which showed the lack of correlation between IT spending in the food
industry and corporate profitability.  He tossed out 19 percent of my
data points to assert that the remaining data showed a positive
correlation between IT spending and profitability.  That is factually
not true.  By keeping two high-profit firms in and then tossing out
two of the highest underperforming spenders, he made his numbers come
out the way he wished.  This is not statistics.  This is
misrepresentation.

For the record, I should note that I have never met Bob Lewis and have
not engaged in a competitive situation with his firm.  As an InfoWorld
columnist, he is entitled to his opinions, but not to deliberate
misrepresentation of facts or to gross misuses of statistics, both of
which I believe he has done.

Although Lewis&rsquo; columns were published in InfoWorld more than a year
ago and I responded to the first one, I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the two
additional columns until March of this year.  In reviewing my
forthcoming book, Information Productivity, InfoWorld Editor in Chief
Sandy Reed mentioned those columns.  (See "InfoWorld is at the center
of the intersection where IT and business collide," <a
href="http://www.infoworld.com/printlinks">www.infoworld.com/printlinks</a>.)
She suggested that I write this guest column to set the record right,
for which I am most grateful.
