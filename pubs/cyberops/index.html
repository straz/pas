<h1>Cyber Operations</h1>
<div class="subH1">an online course by Paul A. Strassmann</div>

</div>

<div class="leftcol">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<P>In the last two years Paul A. Strassmann delivered five courses on 
<em>Cyber Operations</em>, validating the effectiveness of interactive
on-line teaching about topics related to the safeguarding of national
security systems. With completion of testing, involving over a hundred
students, this course is now available for sponsorship by
organizations interested in executive development of personnel in
dealing with cyber matters.</P>

<P>The Cyber Operations courses were offered to graduate students in the 
George Mason University School of Engineering and in the AFCEA (Armed 
Forces Communications and Electronics Association) Professional 
Development Center. The courses were listed in the catalogues of both 
organizations.</P>

<h2>Scope of the Course</h2>
<p>The lessons provide students with a technical overview of the current 
cyber issues as they relate to policy-level and managerial issues. The course 
content deals with topics that are of primary interest to the Department of 
Defense personnel, the Department of Homeland Security, National 
Intelligence organizations and its contractors who will be carrying much of the 
responsibility for actual implementation of cyber-related systems.</P>

<P>The subject matter covered is diverse. Each weekly session is two
and a half hours. Curriculum can be offered at different levels of
security. The sessions:<P>

<ol class="classes">
<li>Introductions to the Course on Cyber Operations</li>
<li>Information Technology for Cyber Operations</li> 
<li>Attacks on Cyber Security</li>
<li>Internet Networks</li>
<li>Networks and Cyber Operations</li> 
<li>Security of Cyber Operations</li>
<li>Cyber Operations on Data Center Clouds</li>
<li>Virtualization and Legacy Systems</li>
<li>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure in Cyber Operations</li> 
<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
<li>Data and Storage Management</li> 
<li>Open Source Software</li>
<li>Collaboration in Cyber Operations</li>
</ol>

<P>There are more than 75 slides shown in every class and are provided a 
week ahead of each class so that students can be prepared to ask questions. 
Students are able to annotate the presentation material with a real-time on-line 
&ldquo;chat&rdquo; commentary.</P>

<h2>Course Benefits</h2>

<P>Students will acquire an understanding of how the latest
information technologies apply to cyber operations.  Emphasis will be
placed on the most recent technological developments, such as cloud
computing, defensive countermeasures, zero-day vulnerabilities, cyber
threats and the available technological means to systems security. The
presentations will not cover detailed technical topics that can be
found in existing textbooks. Concentration will be on the most recent
developments, including reviews of cyber attacks as they occur.</P>

<P>This course can be seen as a career enhancement for personnel
seeking added skills to qualify for managerial positions that are now
opening in support of cyber operations.</P>

<h2>Course Logistics</h2>

<P>Courses will run weekly in evening from
7:30<span class="sc">PM</span> to 9:30<span class="sc">PM</span>
(Eastern Time) for thirteen consecutive sessions using either
Blackboard or CISCO Webex groupware.</P>

<P>Students will receive a personal invitation with secure links for
each class.</P>

<h2>Course Requirements</h2>

<P>Students must have at least four years of prior experience working with 
information technologies.  Students will have to respond, in writing, to two 
quizzes about the topics covered in each session. A student who cannot attend 
will receive a password for a recording.</P>

<P>Every student&rsquo;s desktop must come equipped with a camera. During class 
discussion the student&rsquo;s picture will appear on the screen.</P>

<P>Students will see on their desktops the instructor&rsquo;s
presentation outline (usually slides), white boards and space for
write-in comments. When a student has a question they can click on
their message to prompt the instructor for a response.</P>

<P>Depending how a sponsor organizes classes it is possible for written 
comments to be graded. Graduate level grades, for academic credit from an 
accredited institution, are also available.</P>
