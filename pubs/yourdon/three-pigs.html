In the story about the three little pigs and the big bad wolf, the
little pigs' project planning horizons determine the outcomes of their
projects.  Similarly, we have project managers who deliver
applications that crash easily and cannot be restored except by heroic
efforts and emergency doses of cash.  Project managers with the
put-the-twigs-together mentality are a widespread phenomenon.  Their
costs are low.  They deliver on budget.  But woe to anyone who
inherits their output.  Their successors are stuck with escalating
maintenance expenses, customer complaints, and blame for poor
management.<p>

There are also project managers who build projects as if they were made
of bricks.  Their budgets are large.  After installation, the
maintenance expenses remain low, since well-architected systems can
withstand a great deal of alteration.<p>

When disaster strikes, the little pigs with flimsy "legacy" systems do
not necessarily end up in the house built by their long-range-planning
brother.  In my updated version of the old tale -- with which I
entertained my grandchildren -- the pigs end up outsourcing their
living quarters to wolves who advertise prefabricated pigpens.<p>

Why do most project managers persist in delivering flimsy results?  It
is not because they are self-destructive or ignorant of the likely
consequences.  In this article, I will show that one of the prime
reasons for the delivery of shoddy projects is the myopic approach to
the planning and budgeting of information systems projects.<p>

<h3>Planning Horizons And Residual Value</h3>

The appropriate "planning horizon" for computer systems varies
depending on the quality of the initial project investment and the
expense of making changes.  Any investment that has an annual
maintenance expense of 25 percent of the initial cost -- a
not-uncommon case -- can be said to have a "planning horizon" of only
four years.<p>

Your controller may insist on project investments that have a payback
of less than 24 months.  Indirectly, he or she is telling you that what
is left of your project after two years isn't worth a dime.  In
financial terms, a two-year payback requirement implies that the
corporate treasury considers your project a sufficiently high credit
risk that it will charge you an interest rate of 50 percent per annum.<p>

If a bank were to ask you that for an automobile loan, you would take
it as an insult to your personal integrity.  Computer project managers
instead respond by delivering on such a demand.  They know that the
life of what they deliver will be short.  The two-year payback will
turn out to be a self-fulfilling outcome.<p>

Yet the amazing thing about computer project investments is their
longevity.  I have installed applications over 20 years ago that, with
some technological reincarnation and reasonable maintenance expense,
are still in place today.  I have clients that are running applications
whose core has aged gracefully over 30 years.<p>

There are elements of investments that intrinsically become very
long-term commitments.  There is no way one can establish data
dictionaries and data models for an enterprise without taking a very
long-term view of such a commitment.  This will require a very costly
and difficult initial effort, as evidenced by the great pain and costs
of all of those firms currently installing the SAP integrated
applications.  However, once a data dictionary and data model process
is in place, it is most likely going to remain in place for more than
20 years, and perhaps longer than that.<p>

Strategic planning for information technology projects must therefore
include scenarios that explicitly recognize cash flows that extend
beyond the usual three- or five-year long-range plans.  In other words,
the "residual" value of a project must become an element in all project
payoff calculations.<p>

I find that the concept of assessing the residual value of a project is
not used for information technology planning and budgeting.  Yet nobody
who rejects the idea would ever consider buying a house instead of
renting one.  Without estimating the resale value of a house, one would
always continue renting.<p>

The reason information project managers feel compelled to construct the
flimsiest solutions to systemic problems is their failure to consider
the residual value.  By not considering the residual value of an
investment, systems managers shortchange their management.  Whatever
management saves in initial investment expense will ultimately show up
as higher ongoing overhead expenses and lower profits.  Without paying
attention to residual value, executive management will get exactly what
it locked into in the payoff calculations when approving a project
budget.  The corporation will get what the little pig got by
constructing a shelter out of twigs to have more time for play and fun.<p>

<h3>Financial Analysis For Residual Value Calculation</h3>

The key financial cost parameters for project investment decisions are:

<ol>
<li>The initial cost (investment), on which everyone concentrates.<p>

<li>The installation costs beyond the project manager's control, such as
training, support, and conflict resolution (which rarely shows up in
project budgets).<p>

<li>The ongoing maintenance costs over the life cycle, including costs
of errors, effort needed to retrace undocumented logic, retraining, and
enhancements to accommodate organizational change.  These elements are
usually left out of project planning and budgeting lest management
become discouraged.<p>

<li>The residual value (e.g., the value of an investment at the end of
the planning period), which nobody calculates because nobody wishes to
raise questions about the lasting value of previous investment
decisions.<p>

</ol>

<h3>Residual Value</h3>
The residual value is one of the key factors to consider when
evaluating information technology projects.  The residual value is the
discounted cash flow today from the values that still generate net
benefits to the corporation beyond the planning period.  I have found
that for well-conceived projects, approximately half of the discounted
cash value comes from a cash flow beyond a six-year planning horizon!<p>

Table 1 shows what an investment would look like without residual value
-- the way these analyses are usually done.  The number that is
important is the cash benefit to cash expenditure ratio of 31 percent.
This allows for the discounting of future gains, but that is not
adequately realized even at a high discount rate such as the 25 percent
that I have used in this example. <a href="three-pigs-fn.html">[1]</a><p>

<pre><b>   Table 1:  Project Benefit/Cost Ratio</b>

               1986    1987    1988    1989    1990    1991
   Benefits       0       0    83.4    72.3    82.2    91.4
   Costs       63.3    31.5    14.5    15.0    15.0    17.2

   Net present value of cash benefits @ 25% = 123
      Net present value of cash costs @ 25% =  94
         Benefit/Cost Ratio = (123 - 94)/94 = 31%
</pre>


Table 2 provides the identical example but with a residual value.  The
payback has now gone up to 81 percent.  What this demonstrates is that
if the useful life of the application can be extended beyond the
immediate planning period, the return on the investment is almost
tripled.<p>

<pre><b>   Table 2: Project Benefit/Cost Ratio with a 12-year Residual Value</b>

               1986    1987    1988    1989    1990    1991    <b>Residual Value</b>
   Benefits       0       0    83.4    72.3    82.2    91.4    <b>340.5</b>
   Costs       63.3    31.5    14.5    15.0    15.0    17.2    <b> 64.1</b>

   Net present value of cash benefits @ 25% with residual value = 195
      Net present value of cash costs @ 25% with residual value = 107
             Cash+Residual Benefit/Cost Ratio = (195 - 107)/107 =  81%

</pre>

 Any standard spreadsheet can be used to compute the present value of
discounted cash flow.<a href="three-pigs-fn.html">[2]</a><p>

It is in the interest of information managers
to come up with a standard approach for determining the risk-adjusted
discounted economic value of every project over its entire life cycle.
This will make it possible to explain to top management why projects
made like "brick houses" may be better investments than shanties made
out of scraps of lumber.<p>

<h3>How To Create A Greater Residual Value</h3>

When you examine the total functional cost of information handling for
an organization, the most valuable property is the training of people
to understand and apply the information delivered by computers.  Rather
than considering information technology as hardware and software that
must be used until they become obsolete, it should be noted that most
of the costs are incurred by the user.  When rapid-response online
systems are applied to enlarge the roles and responsibilities of the
people who operate personal computers, the user cost is particularly
severe because the operators have to use information technology under
conditions of stress.  Dissimilar protocols, inconsistent graphic
interfaces, and application-unique commands are not only costly but
confusing and lead to errors.<p>

Greater residual value of individual projects can be created by
imposing familiar information manipulation methods across all
applications.  It is this capability that explains the amazing growth
in the acceptance of Mosaic and Netscape.<p>

The other crucial long-term information assets are data and software.
Software increasingly represents the collective intelligence of how an
enterprise is put together.  The accumulation of data represents the
facts about the enterprise's environment and how it copes with that
environment.  Everything in between -- equipment and operating
software -- is a commodity product that becomes obsolete at a
prodigious rate.<p>

Consequently, the goal of the residual value approach is to preserve
the long-term assets, such as the training contents.  Residual value is
enhanced if the supporting intelligence of an enterprise can be
retained while the hardware and operating system software are upgraded,
modified, or migrated.<p>

To be able to detach obsolescent technologies, organizations should
adopt tools that keep the long-term knowledge assets and short-term
technological assets separated.  This calls for the creation of a
snap-in, snap-out, disposable type of information infrastructure that
must be standardized at the highest levels of the architecture while
leaving much autonomy in adapting to user needs, such as for local
applications.  One way of looking at the value of so-called "open
systems" is to define them in terms of the magnitude of their residual
value.<p>

To achieve this snap-in, snap-out environment requires the adoption of
an integrated computer-aided systems engineering environment.  "Open
systems" without open systems tools will not work.  You must have a way
of bolting large quantities of reusable code onto new hardware without
incurring much pain during the migration from the old to the new.<p>

The underlying concept is to have a development environment
sufficiently long-lived that some of the most important possessions,
such as data structures, may be preserved for up to 25 to 30 years.
Such a development environment should not be based upon a particular
procedural code or hardware, but upon the functional processes that
define the operational rules and work flow patterns.  It should employ
machine-independent languages.  Nothing I say here is just wishful
thinking.  The overwhelming and rapid acceptance of the Java language
is good evidence that the time has come for organizations to seek
solutions that have a residual value that outlasts short-term hardware
and operating systems product offerings.<p>

I cannot overemphasize the pivotal importance of software tools as the
enablers for joining long-term software assets with transient assets
such as hardware and operating systems.  Open systems toolsets are the
means for creating a greater economic value through the enhancement of
the residual value of any technological investment.<p>

Are standard software engineering tools sufficient to preserve the
long-term residual value?  In the same way that operating systems stan-
dards, interoperability architectures, and communications protocols are
necessary but not sufficient, systems engineering tools are also
necessary but not sufficient.  We have to raise our sights to ensure
that organizational knowledge is preserved within our organizations.<p>

<h3>Reusable Software</h3>

In my last job, we determined that half of the potential reductions in
software life-cycle costs were achievable through one variable only --
reusable software.  This is by far the most critical element in
generating a residual value gain from software investments.<p>

To be economically advantageous, new systems must have substantially
lower maintenance costs than earlier implementations, and they must
have a very high degree of code portability.  My minimum target for
portability is for 60 percent of the software code to be portable to
the next generation of hardware after six years of initial life.<p>

The six-year cycle is dictated not by hardware technology, which is now
on an 18-month cycle, but by the rate of innovation in business.  It is
crucial to understand that it is the internal organizational structure
that generates the diversity in information systems requirements that
leads to demands for new applications.  It is the rate of change in
internal procedures that drives the rate of replacement of applications
systems.  Any corporation that believes that its procedures and
organizational structure will be able to survive more than six years is
working under questionable assumptions.<p>

<h3>Software As Collective Organizational Memory</h3>

One way of looking at software is to view it as a continuation of
organizational communications.  Software encapsulates the agreements
reached among contending bureaucracies.  Software requirements are the
means by which users communicate with programmers.  Software statements
are the means by which programmers communicate with machines and
machines respond to users.<p>

To increase the residual value of software embedded in databases, there
must be a good understanding of what is to be done among all those who
participate in the software creation process.  All of this must be
adaptable and rapid.  Programmers, testers, analysts, and users must
employ shared methods for understanding the outcomes in order to
achieve lasting cooperation.<p>

This leads me to conclude that what we call software expense is, in
fact, a way of recording expenses that mostly cover meetings, head
scratching, and shouting matches.  Only a small fraction of the
development cost of a project is in the act of programming!  Therefore,
if you want systems that last, the human dimensions of software
creation, maintenance, and development have to be easier, more open,
and more graceful than has been the case thus far.<p>

How, then, do you conserve organizational memory?  You look at software
as a way of codifying how people increase their understanding of the
way their enterprise conducts its business.  What matters is the
capacity to capture in the form of software the collective experience
of every person who has participated in the conception of business
procedures and work flow arrangements.  You can start looking at
systems development as a means for collective knowledge-sharing.  The
formalization of business processes is then a method for recording
organizational memory and for displaying how members of the
organization negotiated terms of their cooperation.  Systems
development and maintenance should therefore be seen as part of a
continual, evolutionary process rather than a discrete project.<p>

Organizations have deep roots.  This is often referred to as the
"culture," which is rarely articulated.  It remains unfathomable, as if
it were unspoken tribal customs that can be understood only by an
anthropologist or somebody who has been around for a long time.  Such
"culture" provides stability that is independent of the members of the
organization.  As many of the customs, processes, and conventions of an
organization now migrate into a software-managed relationship, the
poverty of current systems engineering methods ends up diminishing the
ways in which people used to work out terms of cooperation through
implicit codes of behavior.<a href="three-pigs-fn.html">[3]</a><p>

For an organization to enhance the residual value of its
knowledge-management systems, it must be able to carry its
culture-like codes from generation to generation without
technology-induced mutations.  New projects conceived to replace
"legacy" systems, especially if imposed by outside consultants or
off-the-shelf packages, always introduce such random mutations.  This
is why a high residual value of information systems preserves not only
the technical but also the human values.<p>

Software is a form of wealth.  In fact, a large number of organizations
today have software assets that are worth more than the tangible assets
on their balance sheet.  Thus the primary objective of modern
information systems management is to manage that wealth and conserve it
so that as little value as possible is destroyed in the process of
technological innovation.  Creating residual value is one means of
assuring the continued accumulation of knowledge.  Projects with
short-term expiration dates will make certain that knowledge is not
accumulated but is instead transformed into profit-sapping adventures.<p>

<h3>Software As The Organization's Inheritance</h3>
Legacy systems and legacy software should not be viewed as something
you get rid of so you can start anew.  Instead they should be
considered more as an inheritance that is to be built upon through
continual rejuvenation and replenishment, because these systems were
originally conceived for extended longevity.  Some of the best
programming talent should be devoted to assuring the residual value of
legacy systems instead of the current practice of heaping the greatest
rewards on builders of brand-new applications.<p>

Every new system enhancement should be conceived of as a way to exploit
and increase the value of the accumulated know-how.  When you analyze
the structure of information systems, you will discover it is not the
elements of logic that change but the way they are put together.  In a
typical business application, more than 85 percent of basic routines
deal with information retrieval, information management, and
information displays.  We continually discard systems even though the
underlying business attributes remain very much alike.  We can no
longer afford to do this, because the accumulation of systems code is
simply too large to be replaceable.  The implementation of an
environment that enhances residual value calls not just for hardware
independence, but also for a discipline that emphasizes software
preservation throughout the entire design process, starting from
business process engineering and ending in reuse of software objects.<p>

<h3>Political Structure For Creating Residual Value</h3>

There is a political dimension to all of this that has not been
adequately aired.  For sharing and accumulation of knowledge, you need
an open political structure that allows people to work together in a
spirit of cooperation.  If information systems are to achieve
longevity, they must gracefully accommodate changing administrative
processes and evolving relationships with vendors and customers.  You
want to design systems that can be extended -- even if that costs more
-- because you need the capacity to evolve your business processes in
short learning cycles, rather than the stop-and-go mode associated with
projects that take years to approve and to build.  The winner in the
accumulation of residual values will be the firm that possesses designs
that accommodate a wide range of business process options.  With the
pendulum swinging back and forth between centralization and
decentralization, mergers and divestment, information systems designs
must be able to adapt to a wide range of choices of how to organize for
tactical purposes.<p>

If you wish to preserve the collective knowledge of the enterprise,
insist that any major new investment proposal include a large residual
value forecast.  You need to ensure that you put as much of the
investment as possible into long-lasting assets such as data, the
telecommunications structure, and configuration management.<p>

It is also important that innovation, which is fleeting, local, and
absolutely essential for preserving a sense of freedom and
independence, is not stifled by heavy-handed emphasis on only the
long-range outcomes.  The beauty of a federation-like approach to
organizational politics<a href="three-pigs-fn.html">[4]</a> is that
you can encourage local
applications.  When these turn out to have permanent value, they can be
quickly moved up in the hierarchy and fitted into more permanent
designs.  It is important that the dynamics of innovation be preserved
in a layered concept of how to structure information systems designs,
because most of the good ideas are usually found in "bootleg"
adventures that cannot withstand the examination of any of the formal
methods of financial analysis.<p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
The current approach to calculating payoff from information technology
investments is faulty in that it disregards what are perhaps the most
valuable contributions toward building up the knowledge-based assets of
a firm.<p>
  
The current methods of investment analysis focus only on the
apparent costs of acquiring information technologies.  They do not
explore the full life-cycle cost effects.  They neglect systems
impacts beyond the typical short-term corporate planning horizons of
not more than three to five years.<p>

Software does not wear out; indeed, it is potentially immortal.  Given
this fact, the IT industry's disregard of the effects of software's
residual value is especially harmful.  It will tend to increase
maintenance, conversion, and overhead expenses.  It will continue to
destroy the incentive to build up the knowledge assets of a firm.<p>

For the last 85 years, children have grown up with various versions of
the story of the three little pigs.  The moral of that story is known
to just about all literate persons.  The time has come for the managers
of information systems to apply that lesson to project management.<p>

Ventures that build shanty-like constructs out of scraps of code,
glued-together shrink-wrap applications, and consultants' packages are
not likely to hold up over an extended time.  Lasting careers will be
made only by those systems managers who can demonstrate that their
projects make it possible to accumulate enduring knowledge assets.<p>
