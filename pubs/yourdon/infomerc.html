<h2>The Internet: A Way Of Outsourcing Infomercenaries?</h2>
<b>by Paul A. Strassmann<br><br>

August 1995<hr>

Speculations about the effects of the &quot;information highway&quot; on work have
reached a new pitch. Books such as Jeremy Rifkin's The End of Work, Cliff
Stoll's Silicon Snake Oil, Danny Goodman's Living at Light Speed, and
Nicholas Negroponte's Being Digital range from prophecies of massive
unemployment to utopian visions in which people will work, entertain, and
communicate mostly through electronic intermediation.<p>

In the first half of 1995, I have counted over 50 nationally advertised
meetings and symposia devoted to conjectures on the effects of the
Internet. Newspapers and magazines now make the Internet headline news.
Bookstores find Internet volumes their fastest-moving technical books.
Adult education programs find that any course with the Internet in the
title is a sure sellout, as a large contingent of information workers
become apprehensive about their prospects for making a living off the
information highway.<p>

Even though much of this fuss is entertaining - if misinformed - computing
professionals should not take it lightly. Whatever sociological or economic
forces will spring forth from the digitization and so-called
&quot;demassification&quot; of society, the readers of this journal are likely to be
exposed to their effects sooner and more intensely than anyone else.<p>

<h3>The Atomized Mercenary Vision</h3>

The MIT Sloan School of Management recently hosted a roundtable of
distinguished executives and professors to discuss the organization of
work in the year 2020 <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. The vision advanced by 
MIT's Thomas Malone - and
not disputed much by the other participants-was of a workplace consisting
of firms with only one employee working from home or a hotel-like office.
These &quot;freelance&quot; operators would come together only in temporary
combinations whenever new projects were authorized.<p>

According to Malone's vision, independent consultants would do all systems
work. Work would be outsourced to computer services corporations that would
specialize in contracting for the individual contributors. Using the movie
industry as a model, systems projects would be put together the same way
movies are produced-using temporary teams of directors, camera people, and
actors working on a rented set. The atomized systems professionals would be
connected by multimedia Internet workstations. This would allow these
individuals to offer their services in an electronic auction market. The
allocation of resources would then be accomplished by competition and not
by &quot;management.&quot; I have labeled this model &quot;electronically mediated
mercenary outsourcing.&quot;<p>

Just in case you think the MIT professors were not serious about
visualizing work in the US as an adaptation of movie production, they
explored the question of whether independent individual contractors could
design and manage the production of automobiles. They found it plausible.<p>

<h3>The Deconstructed Organizational Vision</h3>

The influential Computerworld, with perhaps the largest paid circulation of
computer professionals worldwide, also reflected on the spirit of the times
by publishing a story entitled &quot;Hello Cruel World,&quot; which augured the
future prospects for the computing profession <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. 
The essence of this
article was represented by a headline summary:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Forget job security

<li>Shred your job description

<li>Say goodbye to company loyalty

<li>Do not take your paycheck for granted
</ul>

According to this apocalyptic vision, largely reflecting the view of
consultant Jim Bair of The Gartner Group, the catalyst of this destruction
will be &quot;the growing shift to contract information systems workers, be they
systems integrators, outsourcers, or temporary workers.... The Internet
will become the auction yard for a digitally networked labor pool that
transcends any regulatory and cultural barriers. Ultimately, we are
removing the social safety nets for those people who can't find reemployment.&quot;<p>

<h3>What's New?</h3>

How seriously should computer professionals take this vision of
deconstructing organizations? What is the significance of such a view on
careers? Will such an outlook further alienate computer professionals from
seeking personal growth within a corporate framework? Will the acceptance
of a virtual, remote, and freelance existence reinforce what business
managers have suspected all along: that computer people are a class of
employees who remain alien from the rest of the organization?<p>

A student of management with a historical perspective will find the
concepts of atomized individuals and deconstructed organizations strangely
familiar. During the early stages of industrialization, jobs and
enterprises were purposely designed so that workers could be retained only
as long as they were ready, willing, and able to do what the owners wanted.
When their usefulness waned, they were treated as machine parts and
replaced by others who were more compliant, cost less, and became
immediately productive without further training or capital investment.<p>

Although the current visions are more sophisticated, they nevertheless fall
into a pattern that has been historically proven to be destructive.
However, there are important differences between the hire-and-fire
industrial worker of yesteryear and the contemporary computer professional.<p>

First and foremost, the computer budget of corporations is an overhead
expense and consequently suspected of having no relationship to business
productivity. In fact, survey after survey shows that computer
professionals are identified with the rigidification of paper-shuffling
bureaucracies and are therefore of questionable utility. Imposing
marketplace disciplines on that lot by means of outsourcing is seen as a
way to finally discipline an otherwise unmanageable group of employees.
Creating industrial unemployment during the downside of an economic cycle
never required such rationalizations.<p>

Second, over 80 percent of the computer budget of corporations is for
personnel expenses, most of which can be attributed not to doing measurable
work but to learning what the organization wishes to do, attending
meetings, and obtaining technical training on company time. In other words,
systems professionals are paid to spend most of their time acquiring
personal &quot;knowledge capital.&quot; Most of that capital is company specific and
will be lost when the professional leaves. But a large share of that
capital is person specific and will represent an increase in the market
value of the computer professional when he or she decides to take another
job. Industrial employees never had such an advantage, since they rarely
acquired any knowledge capital that would entitle them to increased wages.<p>

In view of these differences, are the prophets of atomized individuals and
deconstructed organizations realistic in reviving concepts of industrial
organization for the information age? Or are the new proponents only
reflecting their personal preferences as university professors and for-hire
consultants?<p>

<h3>The Vietnam Experiment</h3>

The only recent large-scale and well-documented experiment in something
similar to the concept of virtual outsourcing (which I define as
mechanistic treatment of people as replaceable and interchangeable) is the
experience of the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. Soldiers were randomly
assigned to existing units and then rapidly rotated in and out of combat,
only rarely with the same comrades. Their commanding officers hardly ever
stayed on the job more than six months. There was never sufficient time to
build up unit cohesion and team cooperation or to accumulate shared
fighting experiences. Army discipline disintegrated from within because of
lack of trust among the soldiers. The short-term leaders found that when
the time came for action, they had no followers.<p>

Whether systems projects are like combat experience is debatable, although
I find the similarities striking in view of intense global competition for
markets. Based on a study of the Vietnam experience and how the U.S. Army
has finally overcome it, I must reject the idea that enterprise
integration, application development, and cumulative experience can be
achieved by computer professionals who are seen merely as plug-in, plug-out
software subroutines.<p>

<h3>The Enterprise As An Organic System 
<font size="-1"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></font></h3>

The idea that people in an organization are perfectly and instantly
replaceable is based on clockwork thinking that has its roots in
18th century ideas on how to organize mass production for a homogenized
marketplace. The economic, competitive, and social failures of such
thinking are too numerous to require elaboration, although the U.S.
automobile industry and the Soviet Union are required case studies for
anyone who has an inclination toward the mechanistic model of the
enterprise.<p>

In fact, enterprises respond and operate much more as organic systems in
which the performance of every element- regardless of how small-affects the
performance of the entire body, just as the heart, lungs, stomach, brain,
and glands are each indispensable for proper body function. In organic
systems, all parts are essential for the health of the entire organism.
When any one part fails to do its job properly, the system as a whole
fails. Optimizing any part is not likely to improve the functioning of the
entire system. Unless the new component is organically integrated with the
other subsystems, it may actually inhibit overall performance.<p>

The operative term for information systems is not optimization  but
balanced integration. What matters is not so much what each element does
technically but how it fits with everything else. The unique characteristic
of information systems is their pervasiveness. They should be seen not as
isolated technical constructs but as carefully balanced functions that
reflect the behavior of the entire enterprise.<p>

Therefore I have grave doubts whether an overwhelming number of information
professionals can find their most useful economic role as freelance
infomercenaries who just get plugged in to do their bit of isolated work
and then are dismissed. Information systems are the central element of how
the modern enterprise governs itself, how it responds to external
opportunities, and how it manages its resources. This requires a great deal
of company-specific know-how, as well as a steady accumulation of
knowledge.<p>

Companies that think they can obtain economic value-added from information
technologies exclusively in a bid/ask market, just like trading
commodities, are likely to get just such commodity solutions. True, their
labor costs will probably be lower, but they will totally miss the
opportunity to capitalize on the accumulated knowledge of their people.
It's just like the difference between home ownership and renting. After 20
years, the renters have only receipts for their monthly payments and no
valuable assets.<p>

The economic value-added of a model enterprise rests in the unique
characteristics that distinguish it from its competitors. Standard
solutions, therefore, will not give it a competitive edge, which is
essential for not only earning current income, but also for generating
sufficient funds for entering into new ventures.<p>

The infomercenaries who think they can increase their earning power through
for-hire short-term engagements will also be disappointed. If they are
hired for their specific skills, as is likely to be the case, their wages
will be made up of pay for work hours and an allowance for depreciation of
their knowledge assets. The company hiring them will have no reason to
finance their learning new skills. The infomercenaries will therefore have
to look at their short-term wages as an exploitation of their accumulated
know-how, which they will have to fund out of their own pocket to avoid
technological obsolescence.<p>

<h3>The Banking Case</h3>

The relationship between technology and corporate economic performance has
intrigued me for over 20 years. I have studied over 50 industrial sectors
and in each case found that the following generalizations apply:<p>

<ul>
<li>The level of spending for information technology is very similar; it
varies with the size of organizations (see Figure 1).

<li>The technologies used in each industry are almost indistinguishably
identical. As a matter of fact, many industries not only use identical
hardware and software suppliers, but also adopt similar telecommunications
solutions.

<li>The profit performance of each company is totally unrelated to the amount
of information technology it employs (see Figure 2).
</ul>

revenue are always related.

<b>Figure 2:</b> In the homogeneous banking industry<br> information technology 
and profit performance are never related.
<hr><p>

I have used the example of the banking sector-the most homogeneous one-to
illustrate that there is absolutely no correlation between information
technology budgets and profitability, regardless of what economic
performance measure we choose. Information technology is related to input
but not to output. The only plausible explanation for any differences is
the manner in which any enterprise has taken a unique approach to combining
its various elements of people, skill, motivation, and technology to
deliver a result that differs from what competitors do with the identical
resources.<p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

Those who see the future of information professionals as one in which
atomized individuals earn their living as infomercenaries working for
deconstructed organizations should reexamine their predictions.
Organizations are not machines. Organizations are organic systems.<p>

If you view humans as machines, their component organs and chemical
structure are very much alike and often surgically replaceable.
Individuals-like organizations-are unique because of the way those parts
are put together and how they manage their endowment, which increasingly is
not physical but information based.<p>

The prophets of the Internet, in conveying their vision of the future for
professional workers, had better come up with scenarios that are supported
by proven patterns of success. The year 2020 is not so far off that we do
not already have clues as to what works and what doesn't.
Information systems work is a means for an organization to achieve
cooperation, integration, coherence, and uniqueness. I do not think that
infomercenaries can deliver that.<p>
