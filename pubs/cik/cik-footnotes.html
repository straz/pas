<a name="fn2">[2]</a> If a company is in the information services business, the
costs of producing those revenues would be included in the "costs of sales."
S.G.&amp;A is the expense for internal coordination, as well as the efforts
expended in securing cooperation from customers and suppliers.<p>

<a name="fn3">[3]</a> To make the two numbers comparable, I calculate the
"rental" value of equity capital as the average cost of shareholder capital in
1994, which had a median value of 10.5%. <p>

<a name="fn4">[4]</a> The unusually high information to equity ratio for
Germany reflects a financial structure that depends on bank financing to a
greater extent than the US.<p>

<a name="fn5">[5]</a> This calculation is similar, but simpler than
the EVA<font size="-2">(TM)</font> (<i>Economic Value-Added</i>)
publicized by the firm of Stern Stewart &amp; Co.  I have compared the
sums of <i>Management Value-Added</i> with the sums of EVA<font
size="-2">(TM)</font> over an eight year period and found them
reasonably close. <p>

<a name="fn6">[6]</a> <i>Computerworld</i> magazine has used the
<i>Information Productivity<font size="-2">(TM)</font></i> index for
the past two years to publish the "Premier 100 Ranking" of the top US
Corporations in making the most effective use of information
management practices. <p>

<a name="fn7">[7]</a> When some corporate staff unit declares that it caters to
other staffers as "customers", that is just a misnomer. They are overhead and
therefore remain a part of "management" regardless of their claims.<p>

<a name="fn8">[8]</a> Knowledge Ecology and Knowledge Recycling may become the
next management buzzword. Much of the attraction of the recently introduced
Java language may have its origins in the general perception that elements of
all computer applications should be reusable by making them capable of running
on any computer, on any operating system in any network environment. <p>
